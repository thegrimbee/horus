# Horus <br/>

This is the repository for the desktop application, Horus. Horus is an app that scans terms of services of apps for the user and highlights potentially harmful terms.

Currently, Horus is in its earliest stage of development and our team will focus on implementing the following over the few weeks:
1. Being able to locate the terms of service files
2. Being able to scan potentially harmful terms (may not have high accuracy)
3. Having a functional UI

Our tech stack will include:
1. Electron, to design the app itself including its UI and file watching system
2. Python, to handle the backend processing and the AI to analyse the TOS

Our progress can be seen here: https://github.com/users/thegrimbee/projects/1/
