This product uses MediaInfo (https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) library, Copyright (c) 2002-2020 MediaArea.net SARL (info@mediaarea.net). 









This directory contains Vim scripts for syntax highlighting.

These scripts are not for a language, but are used by Vim itself:

syntax.vim	Used for the ":syntax on" command.  Uses synload.vim.

manual.vim	Used for the ":syntax manual" command.  Uses synload.vim.

synload.vim	Contains autocommands to load a language file when a certain
		file name (extension) is used.  And sets up the Syntax menu
		for the GUI.

nosyntax.vim	Used for the ":syntax off" command.  Undo the loading of
		synload.vim.


A few special files:

2html.vim	Converts any highlighted file to HTML (GUI only).
colortest.vim	Check for color names and actual color on screen.
hitest.vim	View the current highlight settings.
whitespace.vim  View Tabs and Spaces.


If you want to write a syntax file, read the docs at ":help usr_44.txt".

If you make a new syntax file which would be useful for others, please send it
to Bram@vim.org.  Include instructions for detecting the file type for this
language, by file name extension or by checking a few lines in the file.
And please write the file in a portable way, see ":help 44.12".

If you have remarks about an existing file, send them to the maintainer of
that file.  Only when you get no response send a message to Bram@vim.org.

If you are the maintainer of a syntax file and make improvements, send the new
version to Bram@vim.org.

For further info see ":help syntax" in Vim.


Some tools that can be used with Vim:

blink.c:	C program to make the cursor blink in an xterm.

ccfilter*:	C program to filter the output of a few compilers to a common
		QuickFix format.

efm_filter.*:	Perl script to filter compiler messages to QuickFix format.

efm_perl.pl:	Perl script to filter error messages from the Perl interpreter
		for use with Vim quickfix mode.

mve.*		Awk script to filter error messages to QuickFix format.

pltags.pl:	Perl script to create a tags file from Perl scripts.

ref:		Shell script for the K command.

shtags.*:	Perl script to create a tags file from a shell script.

vim132:		Shell script to edit in 132 column mode on vt100 compatible
		terminals.

vimm:		Shell script to start Vim on a DEC terminal with mouse
		enabled.

vimspell.*:	Shell script for highlighting spelling mistakes.

vim_vs_net.cmd: MS-Windows command file to use Vim with MS Visual Studio 7 and
		later.

xcmdsrv_client.c:  Example for a client program that communicates with a Vim
		   server through the X-Windows interface.

unicode.vim	Vim script to generate tables for src/mbyte.c.

[xxd can be found in the src directory]


Tutor is a "hands on" tutorial for new users of the Vim editor.

Most new users can get through it in less than one hour. The result
is that you can do a simple editing task using the Vim editor.

Tutor is a file that contains the tutorial lessons. You can simply
execute "vim tutor" and then follow the instructions in the lessons.
The lessons tell you to modify the file, so DON'T DO THIS ON YOUR
ORIGINAL COPY.

On Unix you can also use the "vimtutor" program.  It will make a
scratch copy of the tutor first.

I have considered adding more advanced lessons but have not found the
time. Please let me know how you like it and send any improvements you
make.

Translation
-----------

The tutor.xx and tutor.xx.utf-8 files are translated files (where xx is the
language code).  The encoding of tutor.xx might be latin1 or other traditional
encoding.  If you don't need a translation with such traditional encoding,
you just need to prepare the tutor.xx.utf-8 file.
If you need another encoding, you can also prepare a file named tutor.xx.enc
(replace enc with the actual encoding name).  You might also need to adjust the
tutor.vim file.
The "make" command can be used for creating tutor.xx from tutor.xx.utf-8.
See the Makefile for detail.  (For some languages, tutor.xx.utf-8 is created
from tutor.xx for historical reasons.)
