 But we can also just decide to synchronize and
  contact all copyright holders on record if/when the occasion arises
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification"


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


  1


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee


  2


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License


  9


Each version is given a distinguishing version number


			    NO WARRANTY

  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE


  12
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found

## Supported Git versions

Git Credential Manager tries to be compatible with the broadest set of Git
versions (within reason)
 However there are some know problematic releases of
Git that are not compatible


- Git 2
0


## How to use

Once it's installed and configured, Git Credential Manager is called implicitly
by Git
 (This
process will look slightly different for each Git host, and even in some cases,
whether you've connected to an on-premises or cloud-hosted Git host
) Later Git
commands in the same repository will re-use existing credentials or tokens that
GCM has stored for as long as they're valid

Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD
 Alternatively, you can
  install a recent version of Git LFS from the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey
 [This repository](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation#source)
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases) include a script which will:

- Install Git LFS binaries onto the system `$PATH`
- Run `git lfs install` to
perform required global configuration changes


```ShellSession
$ 
com/repos/git-lfs/git-lfs/tarball/core-gpg-keys | tar -Ozxf -
```

Once you have the keys, you can download the `sha256sums
gz | shasum -a 256 -c
```

For the convenience of distributors, we also provide a wider variety of signed
hashes in the `hashes
asc` file
asc`


## Example Usage

To begin using Git LFS within a Git repository that is not already configured
for Git LFS, you can indicate which files you would like Git LFS to manage
psd` is the pattern of filenames that you wish to track
psd
$ git commit -m "add psd"
```

> _Tip:_ if you have large files already in your repository's history, `git lfs
> track` will _not_ track them retroactively
**
>
> For more information, read [`git-lfs-migrate(1)`](https://github


You can confirm that Git LFS is managing your PSD file:

```bash
$ git lfs ls-files
3c2f7aedfb * my
psd
```

Once you've made your commits, push your files to the Git remote:

```bash
$ git push origin main

## Limitations

Git LFS maintains a list of currently known limitations, which you can find and
edit [here](https://github

project contains a `go

     context diff will do


- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible

  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not
  make a difference


- If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and
  contact information with the "--with-modified-by" configure argument or the
  MODIFIED_BY define

  To help these needy children, a

Health workers are being trained, hygiene education is carried out and
households are stimulated to build a proper latrine
  I helped setting up a

  This is possible because this is a small
organization that works with volunteers
  If you would like to sponsor a
child, you should have the intention to do this for at least one year


How do you know that the money will be spent right?  First of all you have my

These files are used for the `:colorscheme` command
 Use the default Normal color and automatically adjust to the value of

g

	augroup MyColorscheme
	  au!
	  au ColorSchemePre * unlet g:term_ansi_colors
	  au ColorSchemePre * au! MyColorscheme
	augroup END

To customize a colorscheme use another name, e
  "~/

and use ":runtime" to load the original colorscheme: >

	" load the "evening" colorscheme
	runtime colors/evening
vim

	hi Statement ctermfg=Blue guifg=Blue

To see which highlight group is used where, see `:help highlight-groups` and
`:help group-name` 


You can use ":highlight" to find out the current colors
  Use the color names instead for better portability
  See
`:help cterm-colors`

  universally supported


- Is "g:terminal_ansi_colors" set to a list of 16 #RRGGBB values?

- Try to keep your color scheme simple by avoiding unnecessary logic and
  refraining from adding options
  The best color scheme is one that only
  requires: >

  	colorscheme foobar

The color schemes distributed with Vim are built with lifepillar/colortemplate
(https://github

They are used with the ":compiler" command

See ":help write-compiler-plugin"


If you want to write your own compiler plugin, have a look at the other files
for how to do it, the format is simple

Note that the "_" in "c_extra


If you want to do additional settings, or overrule the default filetype
plugin, you can create your own plugin file





This directory contains files to automatically compute the indent for a
type of file


If you want to add your own indent file for your personal use, read the docs
at ":help indent-expression"
  Only when you get no response send a message to Bram@vim


If you are the maintainer of an indent file and make improvements, e-mail the
new version to Bram@vim



Rules for making an indent file:

You should use this check for "b:did_indent":

	" Only load this indent file when no other was loaded yet

	if exists("b:did_indent")
	  finish
	endif
	let b:did_indent = 1

Always use ":setlocal" to set 'indentexpr'


You normally set 'indentexpr' to evaluate a function and then define that
function
  Also be aware of certain features not
being compiled in


The name of the file consists of these parts:

	{language}[-{layout}][_{encoding}]

		When omitted the "normal" encoding for the language is
		assumed

		Use the value the 'encoding' option: lower case only, use '-'
		instead of '_'


Each file starts with a header, naming the maintainer and the date when it was
last changed

and the menu translation file is:

The menu translation file should set the "did_menu_trans" variable so that Vim
