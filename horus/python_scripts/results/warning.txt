Tutor is a "hands on" tutorial for new users of the Vim editor


Most new users can get through it in less than one hour
 You can simply
execute "vim tutor" and then follow the instructions in the lessons

The lessons tell you to modify the file, so DON'T DO THIS ON YOUR
ORIGINAL COPY


On Unix you can also use the "vimtutor" program
  It will make a
scratch copy of the tutor first


I have considered adding more advanced lessons but have not found the
time
 Please let me know how you like it and send any improvements you
make

Translation
-----------

The tutor
xx and tutor
utf-8 files are translated files (where xx is the
language code)
  The encoding of tutor
xx might be latin1 or other traditional
encoding
  If you don't need a translation with such traditional encoding,
you just need to prepare the tutor
xx

If you need another encoding, you can also prepare a file named tutor
xx
vim file
xx from tutor
  (For some languages, tutor
utf-8 is created
from tutor
)
