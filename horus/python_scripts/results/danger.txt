 Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2
2 or v3
x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated


 HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like
 a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make
 their preferences known
 In particular, if you trust me to make that
 decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something
 like

	This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version
	at the discretion of Linus
,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software
  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
)  Each licensee is addressed as "you"


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee


  2


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it


  6
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


  8
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time
  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs



# Git Credential Manager

[![Build Status][build-status-badge]][workflow-status]

## Install

See the [installation instructions][install] for the current version of GCM for
install options for your operating system


## Current status

Git Credential Manager is currently available for Windows, macOS, and Linux\*

GCM only works with HTTP(S) remotes; you can still use Git with SSH:

## Supported Git versions

Git Credential Manager tries to be compatible with the broadest set of Git
versions (within reason)
 However there are some know problematic releases of
Git that are not compatible
26
 For example, when pushing (`git push`) to
[Azure DevOps][azure-devops], [Bitbucket][bitbucket], or [GitHub][github], a
window will automatically open and walk you through the sign-in process

for an overview of features


## Getting Started

### Downloading

You can install the Git LFS client in several different ways, depending on your
setup and preferences
io/github/git-lfs/install)

* **macOS users**
 [Homebrew](https://brew
 In addition, [binary packages](https://github
org), and the
available instructions in our
[Wiki](https://github
asc` file and verify
the file you want like so:

```ShellSession
$ gpg -d sha256sums
asc | grep git-lfs-linux-amd64-v2
 You can read
more about this pattern syntax
[here](https://git-scm
gitattributes` file_
gitattributes
$ git commit -m "track *
 For example, changing a file named `my
psd`
(tracked above via `*
 To migrate existing large files
> in your history to use Git LFS, use `git lfs migrate`
psd" --everything
```

**Note that this will rewrite history and change all of the Git object IDs in your
repository, just like the import version of this command


## Limitations

Git LFS maintains a list of currently known limitations, which you can find and
edit [here](https://github
  Please do not import the `git-lfs`
module into other Go code and do not rely on it as a source code dependency
  There's also a [FAQ](https://github
adoc)
shipped with Git LFS which answers some common questions

  Vim sponsors can vote for
features
  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
    include this license text
  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Vim scripts
org>
net, www
vim

       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
	    version of Vim without fee or restriction

    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
       is able to see that it was modified
  When distributing as mentioned
       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
       not conflict with the license used for the changes
  The preferred way to do this is
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL


=== end of license ===

Note:

- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this
  file and consider helping needy children in Uganda

  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not
  make a difference
  Also when you didn't actually change
  anything in Vim


- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all
  further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license
  The area is known as Rakai
District
  The population is mostly farmers
  Some say that it started there
  In this district about 60,000 children
have lost one or both parents, out of a population of 350,000
  Now that the government is stable again, the children and parents have
to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections
  Because these families are big and the income
(if any) is low, a child is lucky if it gets healthy food
  To help these needy children, a
sponsorship program was put into place

For a few dollars a month KCC sees to it that the child gets indispensable
items, is healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that
needs to be done for the child and the family that supports it

Health workers are being trained, hygiene education is carried out and
households are stimulated to build a proper latrine

They are sold below cost price


There is a clinic at the project, which provides children and their family
medical help
  When needed, transport to a hospital is offered
  This is possible because this is a small
organization that works with volunteers
  If you would like to sponsor a
child, you should have the intention to do this for at least one year

personal guarantee as the author of Vim

README
txt for color scheme files

These files are used for the `:colorscheme` command
  They appear in the
"Edit/Color Scheme" menu in the GUI
com/vim/colorschemes/tree/master/legacy_colors


Hints for writing a color scheme file:

There are two basic ways to define a color scheme:

1
 Use the default Normal color and automatically adjust to the value of
   'background'

  This will also work for groups
that are added in later versions of Vim

Some attributes (e
g

	augroup MyColorscheme
	  au!
	  au ColorSchemePre * unlet g:term_ansi_colors
	  au ColorSchemePre * au! MyColorscheme
	augroup END

To customize a colorscheme use another name, e
  "~/
vim
	" change the color of statements
	hi Statement ctermfg=Blue guifg=Blue

To see which highlight group is used where, see `:help highlight-groups` and
`:help group-name` 
  Use the color names instead for better portability
 as possible


- Is "g:terminal_ansi_colors" set to a list of 16 #RRGGBB values?

- Try to keep your color scheme simple by avoiding unnecessary logic and
  refraining from adding options
  The best color scheme is one that only
  requires: >

  	colorscheme foobar

The color schemes distributed with Vim are built with lifepillar/colortemplate
(https://github


If you want to write your own compiler plugin, have a look at the other files
for how to do it, the format is simple


If you think a compiler plugin you have written is useful for others, please
send it to Bram@vim
vim in this directory and subdirectories will be sourced
by Vim when it detects the filetype that matches the name of the file or
subdirectory
vim
	c_extra
vim" is required to separate the filetype name
from the following arbitrary name
  See ":help ftplugin" in Vim





This directory contains files to automatically compute the indent for a
type of file


If you want to add your own indent file for your personal use, read the docs
at ":help indent-expression"


If you make a new indent file which would be useful for others, please send it
to Bram@vim
org

And please stick to the rules below
org


If you are the maintainer of an indent file and make improvements, e-mail the
new version to Bram@vim



Rules for making an indent file:

You should use this check for "b:did_indent":

	" Only load this indent file when no other was loaded yet
g
, "hebrew", "greek")

{layout}	Optional: name of the keyboard layout (e
g
  When omitted the layout of the standard
		US-english keyboard is assumed
  If necessary, report a problem to the maintainer


The format of the keymap lines below "loadkeymap" is explained in the Vim help
files, see ":help keymap-file-format"
 v:lang 
vim"

When the 'menutrans' option is set, its value will be used instead of v:lang


For example, to use the Big5 (Taiwan) menus on MS-Windows the $LANG will be

	Chinese(Taiwan)_Taiwan
vim

On Unix you should set $LANG, depending on your shell:

	csh/tcsh:	setenv LANG "zh_TW



AUTOMATIC CONVERSION

When Vim was compiled with multi-byte support, conversion between latin1 and
UTF-8 will always be possible
  Other conversions depend on the iconv
library, which is not always available
, between iso-8859-# and
MS-Windows codepages), thus the converted menu file must be available

	press "g"
