 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price
)  Each licensee is addressed as "you"
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU

  The money goes to Uganda anyway
  If there has been no negotiation
	  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes
org and/or comp
  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again
  If you make additional changes the
	  text under a) applies to those changes
  This may be done in the form of a
	  context diff

       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
	    version of Vim without fee or restriction
  When the maintainer
	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
	    available to him

       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
	  any later version
  Although AIDS
is now mostly under control, the problems are still continuing


The key to solving the problems in this area is education
  This has been
neglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil
wars
  There is
also help for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal is to
prevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food


Most of the orphans are living in an extended family
  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods
  Since 2020 a maternity ward was added and 24/7 service is
available
  I have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water
and sanitation

The colorschemes were updated for the Vim 9 release
  If you don't like the
changes you can find the old ones here:
https://github

	endif

You can use `:highlight clear` to reset everything to the defaults, and then
change the groups that you want differently
vim set background=dark

Replace "blue_sky" with the name of the colorscheme


The default color settings can be found in the source file src/syntax


These scripts usually set options, for example 'errorformat'
vim in this directory and subdirectories will be sourced
by Vim when it detects the filetype that matches the name of the file or
subdirectory

Here it proves that vim is a general problem solver (if you bring enough
patience)



Commands:
a<n>		increment register <n>
s<n>		decrement register <n>
<x>;<y>		execute command <x> and then <y>
(<x>)<n>	execute command <x> while register <n> is nonzero

A few special files:

2html

hitest
  Include instructions for detecting the file type for this
language, by file name extension or by checking a few lines in the file

I have considered adding more advanced lessons but have not found the

utf-8 files are translated files (where xx is the
language code)
