These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions

 Use the default Normal color and automatically adjust to the value of
   'background'
 >

	highlight clear Normal
	set background&
	highlight clear
	if &background == "light"
	  highlight Error 



In case you want to set 'background' depending on the colorscheme selected,
this autocmd might be useful: >

     autocmd SourcePre */colors/blue_sky
vim set background=dark

Replace "blue_sky" with the name of the colorscheme
g


- Does it work in a color terminal as well as in the GUI? Is it consistent?

- Is "g:colors_name" set to a meaningful value?  In case of doubt you can do
  it this way: >

  	let g:colors_name = expand('<sfile>:t:r')

- Is 'background' either used or appropriately set to "light" or "dark"?

- Try setting 'hlsearch' and searching for a pattern, is the match easy to
  spot?

- Split a window with ":split" and ":vsplit"
 as possible

For example, these are all loaded for the "c" filetype:

	c
vim
	c/settings
vim" is required to separate the filetype name
from the following arbitrary name
  Include instructions for detecting the file type for this
language, by file name extension or by checking a few lines in the file


You normally set 'indentexpr' to evaluate a function and then define that
function
  Add a test if the function exists and use ":finish", like this:
	if exists("*GetMyIndent")
	  finish
	endif

that it works with any option settings

The contents of each menu file is a sequence of lines with "menutrans"
commands

and use the menu translation file:

  Let the UTF-8 menu file source the latin1 menu file,
and put "scriptencoding latin1" in that one
, between iso-8859-# and
