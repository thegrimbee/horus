 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License
)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope
  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program


  2


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


  4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions


  7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  8
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time


Each version is given a distinguishing version number


  10
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


			    NO WARRANTY

  11
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION


  12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


  To do so, attach the following notices to the program
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version

    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE

    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs
  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library
  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License","
 Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2
2 or v3
 In particular, if you trust me to make that
 decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something
 like

	This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version
	at the discretion of Linus
 But we can also just decide to synchronize and
  contact all copyright holders on record if/when the occasion arises


			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary
  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification""


  1


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program


  5
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission


		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc


","x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated


 HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like
 a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make
 their preferences known
  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification""
)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


  1


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code


  4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance


  5
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


  8
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License


  9
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time
  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation


  10
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


			    NO WARRANTY

  11
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program
  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the

## Supported Git versions

Git Credential Manager tries to be compatible with the broadest set of Git
versions (within reason)
x

  The initial major version of Git is not supported or tested with GCM


- Git 2

  This version of Git introduced a breaking change with parsing credential
  configuration that GCM relies on
 This issue was fixed in commit
  [`12294990`][gcm-commit-12294990] of the Git project, and released in Git

0


## How to use

Once it's installed and configured, Git Credential Manager is called implicitly
by Git
 You don't have to do anything special, and GCM isn't intended to be
called directly by the user
) Later Git
commands in the same repository will re-use existing credentials or tokens that
GCM has stored for as long as they're valid

# Git Large File Storage

[![CI status][ci_badge]][ci_url]

[ci_badge]: https://github
svg
[ci_url]: https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/actions?query=workflow%3ACI

[Git LFS](https://git-lfs
github
com) is a command line extension and
[specification](docs/spec
md) for managing large files with Git


The client is written in Go, with pre-compiled binaries available for Mac,
Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD
 Check out the [website](http://git-lfs
github


* **Linux users**
 Debian and RPM packages are available from
  [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud
io/github/git-lfs/install)

* **macOS users**
 [Homebrew](https://brew
sh) bottles are distributed, and can
  be installed via `brew install git-lfs`

* **Windows users**
 Alternatively, you can
  install a recent version of Git LFS from the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey
 In addition, [binary packages](https://github

* **Building from source**
com/git-lfs/git-lfs
org), and the
available instructions in our
[Wiki](https://github


Note that Debian and RPM packages are built for all OSes for amd64 and i386


### Installing

#### From binary

The [binary packages](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases) include a script which will:

- Install Git LFS binaries onto the system `$PATH`
- Run `git lfs install` to
perform required global configuration changes
/install
sh
```

#### From source

- Ensure you have the latest version of Go, GNU make, and a standard Unix-compatible build environment installed

- Run `make`

- Git LFS requires global configuration changes once per-machine
  To
get these keys, you can run the following command, which will print them to
standard output:

```ShellSession
$ curl -L https://api
asc` file and verify
the file you want like so:

```ShellSession
$ gpg -d sha256sums
asc | grep git-lfs-linux-amd64-v2
tar
gz | shasum -a 256 -c
```

For the convenience of distributors, we also provide a wider variety of signed
hashes in the `hashes
  Those hashes are in the tagged BSD format, but
can be verified with Perl's `shasum` or the GNU hash utilities, just like the
ones in `sha256sums
asc`


## Example Usage

To begin using Git LFS within a Git repository that is not already configured
for Git LFS, you can indicate which files you would like Git LFS to manage
psd""
```

(Where `*
psd` is the pattern of filenames that you wish to track
 You can read
more about this pattern syntax
[here](https://git-scm


> *Note:* the quotation marks surrounding the pattern are important to
> prevent the glob pattern from being expanded by the shell
gitattributes` file_
 This can be done by running:

```bash
$ git add 
gitattributes
$ git commit -m ""track *
psd files using Git LFS""
```

You can now interact with your Git repository as usual, and Git LFS will take
care of managing your large files
 For example, changing a file named `my
psd`):

```bash
$ git add my
 To migrate existing large files
> in your history to use Git LFS, use `git lfs migrate`
 For example:
>
> ```
> $ git lfs migrate import --include=""*
psd"" --everything
> ```
>
> **Note that this will rewrite history and change all of the Git object IDs in your
> repository, just like the export version of this command
**
>
> For more information, read [`git-lfs-migrate(1)`](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-migrate


You can confirm that Git LFS is managing your PSD file:

```bash
$ git lfs ls-files
3c2f7aedfb * my


com/git-lfs/git-lfs-test
   67fcf6a
47b2002  main -> main
```

Note: Git LFS requires at least Git 1
2 on Linux or 1
8


### Uninstalling

If you've decided that Git LFS isn't right for you, you can convert your
repository back to a plain Git repository with `git lfs migrate` as well
  For
example:

```ShellSession
$ git lfs migrate export --include=""*


Git LFS source code utilizes Go modules in its build system, and therefore this
project contains a `go
mod` file with a defined Go module path
  Please do not import the `git-lfs`
module into other Go code and do not rely on it as a source code dependency


## Need Help?

You can get help on specific commands directly:

```bash
$ git lfs help <subcommand>
```

The [official documentation](docs) has command references and specifications for
the tool
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-faq


If you have a question on how to use Git LFS, aren't sure about something, or
are looking for input from others on tips about best practices or use cases,
feel free to
[start a discussion](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/discussions)
 Please be sure to include:

1
 Any failed commands re-run with `GIT_TRACE=1` in the environment, which
   displays additional information pertaining to why a command crashed

The Open Publication License applies to the Vim documentation, see
|manual-copyright|


=== begin of license ===

VIM LICENSE

I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
    that they must include this license text
  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Vim scripts


II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This license text must be included unmodified

    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
	  the distribution how to contact you
  If there has been no negotiation
	  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes

	  The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim
org>
sf
net, www
vim
org and/or comp
  When it is completely
	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
	  your changes ceases
  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again
  This may be done in the form of a
	  context diff
  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim

       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
	    version of Vim without fee or restriction
  When the maintainer
	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
	    available to him
  This
	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
	    as possible

       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
	  any later version

    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the "":version""
       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
       is able to see that it was modified
  When distributing as mentioned
       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
       not conflict with the license used for the changes
  The preferred way to do this is
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL

     If the number of changes is small (e
  The e-mail address to be used is
     <maintainer@vim
  You may use this
     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came
     with, at your option

- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this

- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible

  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not
  make a difference


- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits
  further distribution to the GNU GPL
  Also when you didn't actually change
  anything in Vim


- If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and
  contact information with the ""--with-modified-by"" configure argument or the
  MODIFIED_BY define


==============================================================================
Kibaale Children's Centre		*kcc* *Kibaale*  *charity*

Kibaale Children's Centre (KCC) is located in Kibaale, a small town in the
south of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa
  The area is known as Rakai
District
  The population is mostly farmers
  Although people are poor, there
usually is enough food
  Some say that it started there
  Because
parents die, there are many orphans
  In this district about 60,000 children
have lost one or both parents, out of a population of 350,000
  Although AIDS
is now mostly under control, the problems are still continuing


The children need a lot of help
  The KCC is working hard to provide the needy
with food, medical care and education
  KCC works on a Christian base, but help is given to children of any
religion
  Now that the government is stable again, the children and parents have
to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections


Most of the orphans are living in an extended family
  An uncle or older
sister is taking care of them
  Because these families are big and the income
(if any) is low, a child is lucky if it gets healthy food
  Clothes, medical
care and schooling is beyond its reach
  To help these needy children, a
sponsorship program was put into place
  A child can be financially adopted

For a few dollars a month KCC sees to it that the child gets indispensable
items, is healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that
needs to be done for the child and the family that supports it
  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods

Health workers are being trained, hygiene education is carried out and
households are stimulated to build a proper latrine
  I helped setting up a
production site for cement slabs

They are sold below cost price


There is a clinic at the project, which provides children and their family
medical help
  Since 2020 a maternity ward was added and 24/7 service is
available
  When needed, transport to a hospital is offered

							*donate*
Summer 1994 to summer 1995 I spent a whole year at the centre, working as a
volunteer
  I learned that the help that the KCC provides really helps

When I came back to Holland, I wanted to continue supporting KCC
  Sponsor a child in secondary school: 25 euro a month (or more)

3
  A one-time donation

Compared with other organizations that do child sponsorship the amounts are
very low
  This is because the money goes directly to the centre
  If you would like to sponsor a
child, you should have the intention to do this for at least one year
  Furthermore, the centre has been
co-sponsored and inspected by World Vision, Save the Children Fund and is now
under the supervision of Pacific Academy Outreach Society
  The centre is
visited about once a year to check the progress (at our own cost)
  I have
visited the centre myself many times, starting in 1993
  The visit reports are
on the ICCF web site

README
  They appear in the
""Edit/Color Scheme"" menu in the GUI


The colorschemes were updated for the Vim 9 release
 Define a new Normal color and set the 'background' option accordingly
 >

	set background={light or dark}
	highlight clear
	highlight Normal 


	



	  



	else
	  highlight Error 



	endif

You can use `:highlight clear` to reset everything to the defaults, and then
change the groups that you want differently
  This will also work for groups
that are added in later versions of Vim

Note that `:highlight clear` uses the value of 'background', thus set it
before this command

Some attributes (e
g
, bold) might be set in the defaults that you want
removed in your color scheme


In case you want to tweak a colorscheme after it was loaded, check out the
ColorScheme autocommand event


  ""~/
vim"",
and use "":runtime"" to load the original colorscheme: >

	"" load the ""evening"" colorscheme
	runtime colors/evening
vim
	"" change the color of statements
	hi Statement ctermfg=Blue guifg=Blue

To see which highlight group is used where, see `:help highlight-groups` and
`:help group-name` 
  Exception: the
ctermfg and ctermbg values are numbers, which are only valid for the current
terminal
  Use the color names instead for better portability
  See
`:help cterm-colors` 


The default color settings can be found in the source file src/syntax
c


If you think you have a color scheme that is good enough to be used by others,
please check the following items:

- Source the $VIMRUNTIME/colors/tools/check_colors
vim script to check for
  common mistakes
  Are the status lines and
  vertical separators clearly visible?

- In the GUI, is it easy to find the cursor, also in a file with lots of
  syntax highlighting?

- In general, test your color scheme against as many filetypes, Vim features,
  environments, etc
  Always use #RRGGBB for the GUI
  Names are more portable
  than numbers, though


- Typographic attributes (bold, italic, underline, reverse, etc
) are not
  universally supported
  The best color scheme is one that only
  requires: >

  	colorscheme foobar

The color schemes distributed with Vim are built with lifepillar/colortemplate
(https://github
com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate)
  It is therefore highly
recommended
com/vim/colorschemes)



vim: set ft=help :



This directory contains Vim scripts to be used with a specific compiler

They are used with the "":compiler"" command


These scripts usually set options, for example 'errorformat'
org




The ftplugin directory is for Vim plugin scripts that are only used for a
specific filetype


All files ending in 
vim
	c_extra
vim

Note that the ""_"" in ""c_extra


The filetype plugins are only loaded when the "":filetype plugin"" command has
been used


The default filetype plugin files contain settings that 95% of the users will
want to use
  They do not contain personal preferences, like the value of
'shiftwidth'


If you want to do additional settings, or overrule the default filetype
plugin, you can create your own plugin file
  See "":help ftplugin"" in Vim


If you want to add your own indent file for your personal use, read the docs
at "":help indent-expression""
  Looking at the existing files should give you
inspiration
org

And please stick to the rules below


If you have remarks about an existing file, send them to the maintainer of
that file
  Only when you get no response send a message to Bram@vim
org


If you are the maintainer of an indent file and make improvements, e-mail the
new version to Bram@vim
org



Rules for making an indent file:

You should use this check for ""b:did_indent"":

	"" Only load this indent file when no other was loaded yet

	if exists(""b:did_indent"")
	  finish
	endif
	let b:did_indent = 1

Always use "":setlocal"" to set 'indentexpr'
  This avoids it being carried over
to other buffers
  That function only needs to be defined once for as long as Vim is
running
  Also be aware of certain features not
being compiled in


To test the indent file, see testdir/README



keymap files for Vim

One of these files is loaded when the 'keymap' option is set


The name of the file consists of these parts:

	{language}[-{layout}][_{encoding}]
g
, ""spanish"",
		""russian3"")
  When omitted the layout of the standard
		US-english keyboard is assumed

		When omitted the ""normal"" encoding for the language is
		assumed

		Use the value the 'encoding' option: lower case only, use '-'
		instead of '_'


Each file starts with a header, naming the maintainer and the date when it was
last changed
  If you find a problem in a keymap file, check if you have the
most recent version
  If necessary, report a problem to the maintainer


The format of the keymap lines below ""loadkeymap"" is explained in the Vim help
files, see "":help keymap-file-format""
  Read one of the existing files to get an idea of how this works


More information in the on-line help:

	:help multilang-menus
	:help :menutrans
	:help 'langmenu'
	:help :language

The ""$VIMRUNTIME/menu


	""menu_"" 
 v:lang 
 ""
vim""

When the 'menutrans' option is set, its value will be used instead of v:lang
  It is the full name as the "":language""
command shows (the LC_MESSAGES value)


For example, to use the Big5 (Taiwan) menus on MS-Windows the $LANG will be

	Chinese(Taiwan)_Taiwan
vim

On Unix you should set $LANG, depending on your shell:

	csh/tcsh:	setenv LANG ""zh_TW
Big5""
	sh/bash/ksh:	export LANG=""zh_TW
Big5""

and the menu translation file is:

	$VIMRUNTIME/lang/menu_zh_tw
big5
vim

The menu translation file should set the ""did_menu_trans"" variable so that Vim
will not load another file



AUTOMATIC CONVERSION

When Vim was compiled with multi-byte support, conversion between latin1 and
UTF-8 will always be possible
  Other conversions depend on the iconv
library, which is not always available

Other conversions may not always be available (e
g



































To run the maze macros with Vim:

	vim -u maze_mac maze_5

 include the macros with the vi command:

 when vi solves the maze, you will see why it lies

c will not compile
on the pyramid)


Anyone who can't get the maze
c file to compile, get a new compiler,
try maze
c which was also posted to the net

If you can get it to compile but the maze comes out looking like a fence
and not a maze and you are using SysV or DOS replace the ""27"" on the
last line of maze
c by ""11""

The macros in the maze, hanoi and urm directories can be used to test Vim for
vi compatibility
  They have been written for vi to show its unlimited
possibilities


hanoi	Macros that solve the tower of hanoi problem

life	Macros that run Conway's game of life

urm	Macros that simulate a simple computer: ""Universal Register Machine""



The other files contain some handy utilities
  They also serve as examples for
how to use Vi and Vim functionality


less
vim	make Vim work like less (or more)



The following have been moved to an optional package


packadd! matchit	"" makes the % command work better

packadd! shellmenu	"" menus for editing shell scripts in the GUI version

packadd! swapmouse	"" swap left and right mouse buttons

This is another proof that Vim is perfectly compatible with Vi

The URM macro package was written by Rudolf Koenig (""Rudi"")
(rudolf@koeniglich
de) for hpux-vi in August 1991


Getting started:

type
in your shell:	 vim urm<RETURN>
in vim:		 :so urm
 Per default, 3 and 4
			are multiplied


This is a ""standard URM"" (Universal register machine)  interpreter

Here it proves that vim is a general problem solver (if you bring enough
patience)


The interpreter begins with register 1 (not 0), without macros and more-lines
capability
 (Bug: there must be a space
after the dot
)

The registers are the first few lines, beginning with a '>' 


Output register:	line 2
Input registers:	line 2 to 




Commands:
a<n>		increment register <n>
s<n>		decrement register <n>
<x>;<y>		execute command <x> and then <y>
(<x>)<n>	execute command <x> while register <n> is nonzero

 		(""dot blank"")  halt the machine


Examples:

Add register 2 to register 3:
	(a2;s3)3

Multiply register 2 with register 3:
	(a4;a5;s2)2; ((a2;s4)4; s3; (a1;a4;s5)5; (a5;s1)1)3


There are more (complicated) examples in the file examples

 HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like
 a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make
 their preferences known
 In particular, if you trust me to make that
 decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something
 like

	This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version
	at the discretion of Linus


  might avoid issues
  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License
  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program


  3
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it


  6

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License


  7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission
  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION


  12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms


  To do so, attach the following notices to the program


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details
,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA


If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

# Git Credential Manager

[![Build Status][build-status-badge]][workflow-status]

---

[Git Credential Manager][gcm] (GCM) is a secure
[Git credential helper][git-credential-helper] built on [
NET Framework-based
[Git Credential Manager for Windows][gcm-for-windows] and the Java-based
[Git Credential Manager for Mac and Linux][gcm-for-mac-and-linux]
 However there are some know problematic releases of
Git that are not compatible


- Git 1
 For example, when pushing (`git push`) to
[Azure DevOps][azure-devops], [Bitbucket][bitbucket], or [GitHub][github], a
window will automatically open and walk you through the sign-in process
 (This
process will look slightly different for each Git host, and even in some cases,
whether you've connected to an on-premises or cloud-hosted Git host

## Getting Started

### Downloading

You can install the Git LFS client in several different ways, depending on your
setup and preferences
 Git LFS is included in the distribution of
  [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows
org/)

* **Binary packages**
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases) are
available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD
 [This repository](https://github
git) can also be
built from source using the latest version of [Go](https://golang
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation#source)

- On Windows, install `goversioninfo` with `go install github
com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo/cmd/goversioninfo@latest`

- Place the `git-lfs` binary, which can be found in `bin`, on your systemâ€™s executable `$PATH` or equivalent
 This can be done by
running:

```ShellSession
$ git lfs install
```

#### Verifying releases

Releases are signed with the OpenPGP key of one of the core team members
github

This can be done by running the following _from within a Git repository_:

```bash
$ git lfs track ""*
com/docs/gitattributes))


After any invocation of `git-lfs-track(1)` or `git-lfs-untrack(1)`, you _must
commit changes to your `
adoc)
psd
```

Once you've made your commits, push your files to the Git remote:

```bash
$ git push origin main

```

**Note that this will rewrite history and change all of the Git object IDs in your
repository, just like the import version of this command
**

If there's some reason that things aren't working out for you, please let us
know in an issue, and we'll definitely try to help or get it fixed

You can also sponsor the development of Vim
  The money goes to Uganda anyway
  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
    include this license text
  When the maintainer asks you
	  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
	  must make your changes, including source code, available to the
	  maintainer without fee
  The maintainer reserves the right to
	  include your changes in the official version of Vim
  If this
	  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
	  vim
editors)

       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
	  unmodified, as mentioned at I)
  If you make additional changes the
	  text under a) applies to those changes
  You can choose what license to use for new code you
	  add

	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim

    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections


III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code
g
, a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
     context diff will do


- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all
  further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license
  But this district is suffering from AIDS more than
any other part of the world
  Food and medical care to keep them
healthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the
future


The key to solving the problems in this area is education
  This has been
neglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil
wars
  There is
also help for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal is to
prevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food


Besides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up
needs to be improved

There is a demonstration school at the centre and teacher trainings are given
  These are used to build a good latrine
  Immunization
programs are carried out and help is provided when an epidemic is breaking out
(measles and cholera have been a problem)
  I have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water
and sanitation
  To do this
I'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program
  Please consider one
of these possibilities:

1
  Sponsor a child in primary school: 17 euro a month (or more)

2
  Sponsor the clinic: Any amount a month or quarter
4


How do you know that the money will be spent right?  First of all you have my
personal guarantee as the author of Vim
  I trust the people that are working
at the centre, I know them personally


If you have any further questions, send me e-mail: <Bram@vim


The address of the centre is:
			Kibaale Children's Centre
			p
 box 1658
			Masaka, Uganda, East Africa

Sending money:						*iccf-donations*

Check the ICCF web site for the latest information!  See |iccf| for the URL

txt for color scheme files

These files are used for the `:colorscheme` command
com/vim/colorschemes/tree/master/legacy_colors


Hints for writing a color scheme file:

There are two basic ways to define a color scheme:

1




2


	  

  Use something like ""gui=NONE"" to remove the
attributes


To clean up just before loading another colorscheme, use the ColorSchemePre
autocommand event
  For example: >

	let g:term_ansi_colors = 

	augroup MyColorscheme
	  au!
	  au ColorSchemePre * unlet g:term_ansi_colors
	  au ColorSchemePre * au! MyColorscheme
	augroup END

To customize a colorscheme use another name, e
vim/colors/mine


You can use "":highlight"" to find out the current colors

Search for ""highlight_init""


- Do not use hard coded escape sequences, these will not work in other
  terminals


- When targetting 8-16 colors terminals, don't count on ""darkblue"" to be blue
  and dark, or on ""2"" to be even vaguely reddish


- When targetting 256 colors terminals, prefer colors 16-255 to colors 0-15
  for the same reason
  Don't count on any of them


- Is ""g:terminal_ansi_colors"" set to a list of 16 #RRGGBB values?

- Try to keep your color scheme simple by avoiding unnecessary logic and
  refraining from adding options


If you would like your color scheme to be distributed with Vim, make sure
that:

- it satisfies the guidelines above,
- it was made with colortemplate,

and join us at vim/colorschemes: (https://github

See "":help write-compiler-plugin""


If you want to write your own compiler plugin, have a look at the other files
for how to do it, the format is simple


If you think a compiler plugin you have written is useful for others, please
send it to Bram@vim
vim in this directory and subdirectories will be sourced
by Vim when it detects the filetype that matches the name of the file or
subdirectory





This directory contains files to automatically compute the indent for a
type of file


If you make a new indent file which would be useful for others, please send it
to Bram@vim


To trigger the indenting after typing a word like ""endif"", add the word to the
'indentkeys' option with ""+=""

The ""-u maze



The original README:

To prove that you can do anything in vi, I wrote a couple of macros that
allows vi to solve mazes


Just follow this recipe and SEE FOR YOURSELF
 run uudecode on the file ""maze
 run maze > maze
out and input a small number (for example 10 if
		you are on a fast machine, 3-5 if slow) which
		is the size of the maze to produce

vi
 type the letter ""g"" (for ""go"") and watch vi solve the maze

 Use the default Normal color and automatically adjust to the value of
   'background'
 >

	highlight clear Normal
	set background&
	highlight clear
	if &background == ""light""
	  highlight Error 



In case you want to set 'background' depending on the colorscheme selected,
this autocmd might be useful: >

     autocmd SourcePre */colors/blue_sky
vim set background=dark

Replace ""blue_sky"" with the name of the colorscheme
g


- Does it work in a color terminal as well as in the GUI? Is it consistent?

- Is ""g:colors_name"" set to a meaningful value?  In case of doubt you can do
  it this way: >

  	let g:colors_name = expand('<sfile>:t:r')

- Is 'background' either used or appropriately set to ""light"" or ""dark""?

- Try setting 'hlsearch' and searching for a pattern, is the match easy to
  spot?

- Split a window with "":split"" and "":vsplit""
 as possible

For example, these are all loaded for the ""c"" filetype:

	c

	c/settings

from the following arbitrary name
  Include instructions for detecting the file type for this
language, by file name extension or by checking a few lines in the file


You normally set 'indentexpr' to evaluate a function and then define that
function
  Add a test if the function exists and use "":finish"", like this:
	if exists(""*GetMyIndent"")
	  finish
	endif

  Let the UTF-8 menu file source the latin1 menu file,
