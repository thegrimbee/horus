 Coder Programs

    This Section discusses the deployment rights MathWorks grants you in
    conjunction with your license and use of the Coder Programs: 1) MATLAB
    Coder, 2) Simulink Coder, 3) Embedded Coder, 4) HDL Coder, 5) Filter Design
    HDL Coder, 6) Simulink PLC Coder, and 7) GPU Coder


    The Coder Programs take content that you choose to input
 Depending on the
    Coder Program you use, the input could be a Simulink model, a Stateflow
    diagram, or MATLAB code
 The Coder Program then converts this input to code
    in C/C++, VHDL/Verilog or PLC structured text
  You may copy and deploy 
    these Generated Forms for use outside of the Programs


    In order to enable this output code to work, each of these Coder Programs
    will link in certain files proprietary to MathWorks, which may include C,
    C++, Assembly, linker command files, template makefiles, project files, or
    TLC source code files
 You may only copy, modify, and deploy these
    proprietary MathWorks files in Source Code or Linked Object Code form for
    different development targets when used with the Coder Programs or with
    code generated by the Coder Programs as part of, and only as required by, a
    larger standalone application
 A standalone application is an Application
    created using programming languages and tools other than the Programs,
    which executes outside of the Programs


    3
3
 Simulink Real-Time

    You may use Simulink Real-Time to develop Applications that include Object
    Code derived from Program Components of Simulink Real-Time that are
    required by the Application and that have been compiled or otherwise
    obtained from Simulink Coder on a single development Computer, download
    that Application to a target Computer, and distribute that Application
    beyond the target Computer
 

    3
4
 API Code

    Programs you license may include selected Source Code and shared Object
    Code library files that implement various documented application
    programming interface (API) capabilities


    You may use and modify such Source Code files solely for creation of your
    own Application
 You may copy and distribute Object Code compiled from this
    Source Code, but only as either a standalone Object Code file or Object
    Code linked to your Application, and only for use with and deployment of
    your own Application


    You may use, copy and distribute shared Object Code library files from the
    Programs for deployment of your own Application, but only if a header file
    exists in the Program for the shared library file
 However, you may not
    copy or distribute the header files
 

    3
5
 MAT-Files

    You may create and distribute Applications that read MAT-files using the
    MAT-file API, but if you distribute such Applications to Third Parties,
    they must also implement MAT-file write capability
 As an exception to
    Section 3
4 above, in connection with Applications that read and write
    MAT-files, you may use, copy, and distribute certain shared Object Code
    library files even if no header file exists in the Program for the shared
    library file
 Consult the documentation on Sharing MAT-file Applications
    for a list of permitted files
