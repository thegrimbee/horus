		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


  4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance


  5
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License


  7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License


  10
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this


			    NO WARRANTY

  11
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does


    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc
,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA


If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker
  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library
  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License
NET][dotnet] that runs
on Windows, macOS, and Linux

provide single-factor authentication support for username/password only
NET Framework-based

  The initial major version of Git is not supported or tested with GCM


- Git 2

  This version of Git introduced a breaking change with parsing credential
  configuration that GCM relies on

## How to use

Once it's installed and configured, Git Credential Manager is called implicitly
by Git
 You don't have to do anything special, and GCM isn't intended to be
called directly by the user
 (This
process will look slightly different for each Git host, and even in some cases,
whether you've connected to an on-premises or cloud-hosted Git host
) Later Git
commands in the same repository will re-use existing credentials or tokens that
GCM has stored for as long as they're valid

# Git Large File Storage

com/git-lfs/git-lfs/actions?query=workflow%3ACI

[Git LFS](https://git-lfs
github
md) for managing large files with Git
 Check out the [website](http://git-lfs
github


* **Linux users**
 Debian and RPM packages are available from
  [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud
sh) bottles are distributed, and can
  be installed via `brew install git-lfs`
org/)
 Alternatively, you can
  install a recent version of Git LFS from the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey
org/) package manager

* **Binary packages**
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases) are
available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD

* **Building from source**
 [This repository](https://github
git) can also be
built from source using the latest version of [Go](https://golang
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation#source)


Note that Debian and RPM packages are built for all OSes for amd64 and i386

For arm64, only Debian packages for the latest Debian release are built due to the cost of building in emulation


### Installing

#### From binary

The [binary packages](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases) include a script which will:

- Install Git LFS binaries onto the system `$PATH`
- Run `git lfs install` to
perform required global configuration changes


```ShellSession
$ 
/install
sh
```

#### From source

- Ensure you have the latest version of Go, GNU make, and a standard Unix-compatible build environment installed

- On Windows, install `goversioninfo` with `go install github
com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo/cmd/goversioninfo@latest`

- Git LFS requires global configuration changes once per-machine
 This can be done by
running:

```ShellSession
$ git lfs install
```

#### Verifying releases

Releases are signed with the OpenPGP key of one of the core team members
  To
get these keys, you can run the following command, which will print them to
standard output:

```ShellSession
$ curl -L https://api
github
com/repos/git-lfs/git-lfs/tarball/core-gpg-keys | tar -Ozxf -
```

Once you have the keys, you can download the `sha256sums
10
0
tar
gz | shasum -a 256 -c
```

For the convenience of distributors, we also provide a wider variety of signed
hashes in the `hashes
asc` file
  Those hashes are in the tagged BSD format, but
can be verified with Perl's `shasum` or the GNU hash utilities, just like the
ones in `sha256sums
asc`


## Example Usage

To begin using Git LFS within a Git repository that is not already configured
for Git LFS, you can indicate which files you would like Git LFS to manage

This can be done by running the following _from within a Git repository_:

```bash
$ git lfs track ""*
psd""
```

(Where `*
psd` is the pattern of filenames that you wish to track
com/docs/gitattributes))


> *Note:* the quotation marks surrounding the pattern are important to
> prevent the glob pattern from being expanded by the shell


After any invocation of `git-lfs-track(1)` or `git-lfs-untrack(1)`, you _must
commit changes to your `
psd files using Git LFS""
```

You can now interact with your Git repository as usual, and Git LFS will take
care of managing your large files
psd
$ git commit -m ""add psd""
```

> _Tip:_ if you have large files already in your repository's history, `git lfs
> track` will _not_ track them retroactively
 For example:
>
> ```
> $ git lfs migrate import --include=""*
psd"" --everything
> ```
>
> **Note that this will rewrite history and change all of the Git object IDs in your
> repository, just like the export version of this command
**
>
> For more information, read [`git-lfs-migrate(1)`](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-migrate
adoc)


You can confirm that Git LFS is managing your PSD file:

```bash
$ git lfs ls-files
3c2f7aedfb * my
2 KB/s
# 



To https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs-test
   67fcf6a

47b2002  main -> main
```

Note: Git LFS requires at least Git 1
8
2 on Linux or 1
8
5 on macOS


### Uninstalling

If you've decided that Git LFS isn't right for you, you can convert your
repository back to a plain Git repository with `git lfs migrate` as well
  For
example:

```ShellSession
$ git lfs migrate export --include=""*
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Limitations)


Git LFS source code utilizes Go modules in its build system, and therefore this
project contains a `go
mod` file with a defined Go module path
  However, we
do not maintain a stable Go language API or ABI, as Git LFS is intended to be
used solely as a compiled binary utility


## Need Help?

You can get help on specific commands directly:

```bash
$ git lfs help <subcommand>
```

The [official documentation](docs) has command references and specifications for
the tool
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-faq


If you have a question on how to use Git LFS, aren't sure about something, or
are looking for input from others on tips about best practices or use cases,
feel free to
[start a discussion](https://github


You can always [open an issue](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues), and
one of the Core Team members will respond to you
 The output of `git lfs env`, which displays helpful information about your
   Git repository useful in debugging

2
 Any failed commands re-run with `GIT_TRACE=1` in the environment, which
   displays additional information pertaining to why a command crashed

VIM LICENSE

I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
    that they must include this license text


II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This license text must be included unmodified

    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
	  the distribution how to contact you
  What the
	  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
	  will be distributed is negotiable

	  The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim
  If this
	  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
	  vim
org and/or comp
  When it is completely
	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
	  your changes ceases
  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again

       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
	  unmodified, as mentioned at I)
  If you make additional changes the
	  text under a) applies to those changes

       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
	  the modified Vim you distribute
  You can choose what license to use for new code you
	  add
  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim

	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim
  When the maintainer
	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
	    available to him

	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you
  This
	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
	    as possible

       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
	  any later version

    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections


III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code

     If the number of changes is small (e
g
, a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
     context diff will do

Kibaale Children's Centre		*kcc* *Kibaale*  *charity*

Kibaale Children's Centre (KCC) is located in Kibaale, a small town in the
south of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa
  Although people are poor, there
usually is enough food
  But this district is suffering from AIDS more than
any other part of the world
  Estimations are
that in the past 10 to 30% of the Ugandans are infected with HIV
  Because
parents die, there are many orphans


The children need a lot of help
  The KCC is working hard to provide the needy
with food, medical care and education
  Food and medical care to keep them
healthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the
future
  KCC works on a Christian base, but help is given to children of any
religion
  This has been
neglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil
wars
  There is
also help for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal is to
prevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food


Most of the orphans are living in an extended family
  An uncle or older
sister is taking care of them
  Clothes, medical
care and schooling is beyond its reach
  A child can be financially adopted


Besides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up
needs to be improved
  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods

There is a demonstration school at the centre and teacher trainings are given
  I helped setting up a
production site for cement slabs
  These are used to build a good latrine
  Since 2020 a maternity ward was added and 24/7 service is
available
  Immunization
programs are carried out and help is provided when an epidemic is breaking out
(measles and cholera have been a problem)

							*donate*
Summer 1994 to summer 1995 I spent a whole year at the centre, working as a
volunteer
  I have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water
and sanitation
  I learned that the help that the KCC provides really helps

When I came back to Holland, I wanted to continue supporting KCC
  To do this
I'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program
  Sponsor a child in primary school: 17 euro a month (or more)

2
  Sponsor a child in secondary school: 25 euro a month (or more)

3
  Sponsor the clinic: Any amount a month or quarter
4
  A one-time donation

Compared with other organizations that do child sponsorship the amounts are
very low
  This is because the money goes directly to the centre
  Less than
5% is used for administration
  I trust the people that are working
at the centre, I know them personally
  The centre is
visited about once a year to check the progress (at our own cost)
  I have
visited the centre myself many times, starting in 1993
  The visit reports are
on the ICCF web site


If you have any further questions, send me e-mail: <Bram@vim

	endif

You can use `:highlight clear` to reset everything to the defaults, and then
change th",,,
e groups that you want differently,,,,
,,,,
Note that `:highlight clear` uses the value of 'background', thus set it,,,
before this command,,,,
, bold) might be set in the defaults that you want,,,
removed in your color scheme,,,,
"  Use something like """"gui=NONE"""" to remove the",,,,
attributes,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
In case you want to set 'background' depending on the colorscheme selected,,,,
this autocmd might be useful: >,,,,
,,,,
     autocmd SourcePre */colors/blue_sky,,,,
vim set background=dark,,,,
,,,,
"Replace """"blue_sky"""" with the name of the colorscheme",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
In case you want to tweak a colorscheme after it was loaded, check out the,,,
ColorScheme autocommand event,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
To clean up just before loading another colorscheme, use the ColorSchemePre,,,
autocommand event,,,,
  For example: >,,,,
,,,,
	let g:term_ansi_colors = ,,,,
g,,,,
vim/colors/mine,,,,
"vim""""",,,,
"and use """":runtime"""" to load the original colorscheme: >",,,,
,,,,
"	"""" load the """"evening"""" colorscheme",,,,
	runtime colors/evening,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
"You can use """":highlight"""" to find out the current colors",,,,
  Exception: the,,,,
ctermfg and ctermbg values are numbers, which are only valid for the current,,,
terminal,,,,
  See,,,,
`:help cterm-colors` ,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
The default color settings can be found in the source file src/syntax,,,,
c,,,,
,,,,
"Search for """"highlight_init""""",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
If you think you have a color scheme that is good enough to be used by others,,,,
please check the following items:,,,,
,,,,
- Source the $VIMRUNTIME/colors/tools/check_colors,,,,
vim script to check for,,,,
  common mistakes,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
- Does it work in a color terminal as well as in the GUI? Is it consistent?,,,,
,,,,
"- Is """"g:colors_name"""" set to a meaningful value?  In case of doubt you can do",,,,
  it this way: >,,,,
,,,,
  	let g:colors_name = expand('<sfile>:t:r'),,,,
,,,,
"- Is 'background' either used or appropriately set to """"light"""" or """"dark""""?",,,,
,,,,
- Try setting 'hlsearch' and searching for a pattern, is the match easy to,,,
  spot?,,,,
,,,,
"- Split a window with """":split"""" and """":vsplit""""",,,,
  Are the status lines and,,,,
  vertical separators clearly visible?,,,,
,,,,
- In the GUI, is it easy to find the cursor, also in a file with lots of,,
  syntax highlighting?,,,,
,,,,
- In general, test your color scheme against as many filetypes, Vim features,,
  environments, etc,,,
,,,,
,,,,
- Do not use hard coded escape sequences, these will not work in other,,,
  terminals,,,,
  Always use #RRGGBB for the GUI,,,,
  Names are more portable,,,,
  than numbers, though,,,

- When targetting 256 colors terminals, prefer colors 16-255 to colors 0-15,,,

If you would like your color scheme to be distributed with Vim, make sure,,,

vim: set ft=help :,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
This directory contains Vim scripts to be used with a specific compiler,,,,
,,,,
"They are used with the """":compiler"""" command",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
These scripts usually set options, for example 'errorformat',,,
,,,,
"See """":help write-compiler-plugin""""",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
The ftplugin directory is for Vim plugin scripts that are only used for a,,,,
specific filetype,,,,
,,,,
For example," these are all loaded for the """"c"""" filetype:",,,
,,,,
	c,,,,
vim,,,,
	c/settings,,,,
vim,,,,
,,,,
"Note that the """"_"""" in """"c_extra",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
"The filetype plugins are only loaded when the """":filetype plugin"""" command has",,,,
been used,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
The default filetype plugin files contain settings that 95% of the users will,,,,
want to use,,,,
  They do not contain personal preferences, like the value of,,,
'shiftwidth',,,,
,,,,
,,,,
If you want to do additional settings, or overrule the default filetype,,,
plugin, you can create your own plugin file,,,
  Looking at the existing files should give you,,,,
inspiration,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
If you have remarks about an existing file, send them to the maintainer of,,,
that file,,,,
  Only when you get no response send a message to Bram@vim,,,,

"	if exists(""""b:did_indent"""")",,,,
	  finish,,,,
	endif,,,,
	let b:did_indent = 1,,,,
,,,,
"Always use """":setlocal"""" to set 'indentexpr'",,,,
  This avoids it being carried over,,,,
to other buffers,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
You normally set 'indentexpr' to evaluate a function and then define that,,,,
function,,,,
  That function only needs to be defined once for as long as Vim is,,,,
running,,,,
"  Add a test if the function exists and use """":finish""""", like this:,,,
"	if exists(""""*GetMyIndent"""")",,,,
	  finish,,,,
	endif,,,,

The user may have several options set unlike you, try to write the file such,,,
that it works with any option settings,,,,
  Also be aware of certain features not,,,,
being compiled in,,,,

keymap files for Vim,,,,
,,,,
One of these files is loaded when the 'keymap' option is set,,,,

"Tutor is a """"hands on"""" tutorial for new users of the Vim editor",,,,

Most new users can get through it in less than one hour,,,,
 The result,,,,
is that you can do a simple editing task using the Vim editor,,,,

 Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project,,,,
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not,,,
 v2,,,,
2 or v3,,,,
x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated,,,
,,,,
,,,,
 HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like,,,
 a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make,,,
 their preferences known,,,,
 In particular, if you trust me to make that,,,
 decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something,,
 like,,,,
,,,,
	This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version,,,
	at the discretion of Linus,,,,
,,,,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA,
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies,,,,
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed,,,
,,,,
,,,,
			    Preamble,,,,
,,,,
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your,,,,
freedom to share and change it,,,,
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by,,,,
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead,,,,
)  You can apply it to,,,,
your programs, too,,,
,,,,
,,,,
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and,,,
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,,,,
distribute and/or modify the software,,,,
"  The """"Program""""", below,,,
refers to any such program or work," and a """"work based on the Program""""",,,
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:,,,,
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,,,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another,,,,
language,,,,
")  Each licensee is addressed as """"you""""",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and,,,
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
2,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in,,,
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any,,,,
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third,,,
    parties under the terms of this License,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively,,,,
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such,,
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an,,,
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a,,,,
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide,,,
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under,,,,
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this,,,
    License,,,,
  But when you,,,,
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based,,,,
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of,,,
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the,,,
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it,,,
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,,,,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of,,,,
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:,,,,
,,,,
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable,,,,
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections,,,
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,,,,
,,,,
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three,,,
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your,,
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete,,,
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be,,,
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium,,,,
    customarily used for software interchange; or,,,,
,,,,
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer,,,,
    to distribute corresponding source code,,,,
  For an executable work, complete source,,,
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any,,,
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to,,,
control compilation and installation of the executable,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering,,,,
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent,,,
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as,,,,
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not,,,
compelled to copy the source along with the object code,,,,
  These actions are,,,,
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License,,,,
  Therefore, by,,,
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the,,,,
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and,,
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying,,,
the Program or works based on it,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
6,,,,
  You may not impose any further,,,,
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein,,,,
  If you cannot,,,,
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this,,,,
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you,,,
may not distribute the Program at all,,,,
  For example, if a patent,,,
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by,,,,
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then,,,
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to,,,,
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
8,,,,
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions,,,,
of the General Public License from time to time,,,,
  Such new versions will,,,,
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to,,,
address new problems or concerns,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Each version is given a distinguishing version number,,,,
  If the Program,,,,
"specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and """"any",,,,
"later version""""", you have the option of following the terms and conditions,,,
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free,,,,
Software Foundation,,,,
  If the Program does not specify a version number of,,,,
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software,,,
Foundation,,,,
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free,,,,
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author,,,
to ask for permission,,,,
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals,,,,
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and,,,,
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS,,,,
,,,,
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs,,,,
,,,,
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest,,,
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it,,,
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms,,,,
>,,,,
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>,,,,
,,,,
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify,,,,
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by,,,,
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or,,,

  See the,,,,
    GNU General Public License for more details,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate,,,,
parts of the General Public License,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your,,,,
school, if any," to sign a """"copyright disclaimer"""" for the program", if,
necessary,,,,

## Getting Started,,,,
,,,,
### Downloading,,,,
,,,,
You can install the Git LFS client in several different ways, depending on your,,,
setup and preferences,,,,
io/github/git-lfs/install),,,,
,,,,
* **macOS users**,,,,
 [Homebrew](https://brew,,,,
 In addition, [binary packages](https://github,,,
org), and the,,,
available instructions in our,,,,
[Wiki](https://github,,,,
asc` file and verify,,,,
the file you want like so:,,,,
,,,,
```ShellSession,,,,
$ gpg -d sha256sums,,,,
asc | grep git-lfs-linux-amd64-v2,,,,
 You can read,,,,
more about this pattern syntax,,,,
[here](https://git-scm,,,,
gitattributes` file_,,,,
gitattributes,,,,
"$ git commit -m """"track *",,,,
 For example, changing a file named `my,,,
psd`,,,,
(tracked above via `*,,,,
 To migrate existing large files,,,,
> in your history to use Git LFS, use `git lfs migrate`,,,
"psd"""" --everything",,,,
```,,,,
,,,,
**Note that this will rewrite history and change all of the Git object IDs in your,,,,
repository, just like the import version of this command,,,
,,,,
,,,,
## Limitations,,,,
,,,,
Git LFS maintains a list of currently known limitations, which you can find and,,,
edit [here](https://github,,,,
  Please do not import the `git-lfs`,,,,
module into other Go code and do not rely on it as a source code dependency,,,,
  There's also a [FAQ](https://github,,,,
adoc),,,,
shipped with Git LFS which answers some common questions,,,,

  Vim sponsors can vote for,,,,
features,,,,
  You can also distribute,,,,
    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must,,,
    include this license text,,,,
  You are also allowed to include executables,,,,
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage,,,
    examples and Vim scripts,,,,
org>,,,,
net, www,,,
vim,,,,
,,,,
       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned,,,,
	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the,,,
	  changes if the following three conditions are met:,,,,
	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute,,,,
	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and,,,
	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official,,,,
	    version of Vim without fee or restriction,,,,
,,,,
    3) A message must be added," at least in the output of the """":version""""",,,
       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim,,,
       is able to see that it was modified,,,,
  When distributing as mentioned,,,,
       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does,,,,
       not conflict with the license used for the changes,,,,
  The preferred way to do this is,,,,
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
=== end of license ===,,,,
,,,,
Note:,,,,
,,,,
- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this,,,
  file and consider helping needy children in Uganda,,,,
,,,,
  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not,,,
  make a difference,,,,
  Also when you didn't actually change,,,,
  anything in Vim,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all,,,
  further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license,,,,
  The area is known as Rakai,,,,
District,,,,
  The population is mostly farmers,,,,
  Some say that it started there,,,,
  In this district about 60,000 children,,,
have lost one or both parents, out of a population of 350,0,,
  Now that the government is stable again, the children and parents have,,,
to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections,,,,
  Because these families are big and the income,,,,
(if any) is low, a child is lucky if it gets healthy food,,,
  To help these needy children, a,,,
sponsorship program was put into place,,,,
,,,,
For a few dollars a month KCC sees to it that the child gets indispensable,,,,
items, is healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that,,
needs to be done for the child and the family that supports it,,,,
,,,,
Health workers are being trained, hygiene education is carried out and,,,
households are stimulated to build a proper latrine,,,,
,,,,
They are sold below cost price,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
There is a clinic at the project, which provides children and their family,,,
medical help,,,,
  When needed, transport to a hospital is offered,,,
  This is possible because this is a small,,,,
organization that works with volunteers,,,,
  If you would like to sponsor a,,,,
child, you should have the intention to do this for at least one year,,,

txt for color scheme files,,,,
,,,,
These files are used for the `:colorscheme` command,,,,
  They appear in the,,,,
"Edit/Color Scheme"""" menu in the GUI",,,,
com/vim/colorschemes/tree/master/legacy_colors,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Hints for writing a color scheme file:,,,,
,,,,
There are two basic ways to define a color scheme:,,,,
,,,,
1,,,,
 Use the default Normal color and automatically adjust to the value of,,,,
   'background',,,,
,,,,
  This will also work for groups,,,,
that are added in later versions of Vim,,,,
,,,,
Some attributes (e,,,,
g,,,,
,,,,
	augroup MyColorscheme,,,,
	  au!,,,,
	  au ColorSchemePre * unlet g:term_ansi_colors,,,,
	  au ColorSchemePre * au! MyColorscheme,,,,
	augroup END,,,,
,,,,
To customize a colorscheme use another name, e,,,
"  """"~/",,,,
vim,,,,
"	"""" change the color of statements",,,,
	hi Statement ctermfg=Blue guifg=Blue,,,,
,,,,
To see which highlight group is used where, see `:help highlight-groups` and,,,
`:help group-name` ,,,,
  Use the color names instead for better portability,,,,
 as possible,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
"- Is """"g:terminal_ansi_colors"""" set to a list of 16 #RRGGBB values?",,,,
,,,,
- Try to keep your color scheme simple by avoiding unnecessary logic and,,,,
  refraining from adding options,,,,
  The best color scheme is one that only,,,,
  requires: >,,,,
,,,,
  	colorscheme foobar,,,,
,,,,
The color schemes distributed with Vim are built with lifepillar/colortemplate,,,,
(https://github,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
If you want to write your own compiler plugin, have a look at the other files,,,
for how to do it, the format is simple,,,
,,,,
,,,,
If you think a compiler plugin you have written is useful for others, please,,,
send it to Bram@vim,,,,
vim in this directory and subdirectories will be sourced,,,,
by Vim when it detects the filetype that matches the name of the file or,,,,
subdirectory,,,,
vim,,,,
	c_extra,,,,
"vim"""" is required to separate the filetype name",,,,
from the following arbitrary name,,,,
"  See """":help ftplugin"""" in Vim",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
This directory contains files to automatically compute the indent for a,,,,
type of file,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
If you want to add your own indent file for your personal use, read the docs,,,
"at """":help indent-expression""""",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
If you make a new indent file which would be useful for others, please send it,,,
to Bram@vim,,,,
org,,,,
,,,,
And please stick to the rules below,,,,
org,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
If you are the maintainer of an indent file and make improvements, e-mail the,,,
new version to Bram@vim,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Rules for making an indent file:,,,,
,,,,
"You should use this check for """"b:did_indent"""":",,,,
,,,,
"	"""" Only load this indent file when no other was loaded yet",,,,
g,,,,
," """"hebrew"""""," """"greek"""")",,
,,,,
{layout}	Optional: name of the keyboard layout (e,,,,
g,,,,
  When omitted the layout of the standard,,,,
		US-english keyboard is assumed,,,,
  If necessary, report a problem to the maintainer,,,
,,,,
,,,,
"The format of the keymap lines below """"loadkeymap"""" is explained in the Vim help",,,,
files," see """":help keymap-file-format""""",,,
 v:lang ,,,,
"vim""""",,,,
,,,,
When the 'menutrans' option is set, its value will be used instead of v:lang,,,
,,,,
,,,,
For example, to use the Big5 (Taiwan) menus on MS-Windows the $LANG will be,,,
,,,,
	Chinese(Taiwan)_Taiwan,,,,
vim,,,,
,,,,
On Unix you should set $LANG, depending on your shell:,,,
,,,,
"	csh/tcsh:	setenv LANG """"zh_TW",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
AUTOMATIC CONVERSION,,,,
,,,,
When Vim was compiled with multi-byte support, conversion between latin1 and,,,
UTF-8 will always be possible,,,,
  Other conversions depend on the iconv,,,,
library, which is not always available,,,
, between iso-8859-# and,,,
MS-Windows codepages), thus the converted menu file must be available,,,
78,,,,
"	press """"g""""",,,,
,,,,
"The """"-u maze",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
The original README:,,,,
,,,,
To prove that you can do anything in vi, I wrote a couple of macros that,,,
allows vi to solve mazes,,,,
" run uudecode on the file """"maze",,,,
macros,,,,
"macros""""",,,,
	(If you can't wait to see the action, jump to step 4),,,
	2,,,,
 compile maze,,,,
"c with """"cc -o maze maze",,,,
 run maze > maze,,,,
 edit the maze (vi maze,,,,
macros and all will be revealed,,,,
,,,,
Tested on a sparc, a sun and a pyramid (although maze,,,
c will not compile,,,,
on the pyramid),,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Anyone who can't get the maze,,,,
"c by """"11""""",,,,

,,,,
Thanks to antonyc@nntp-server,,,,

  Add the command to your,,,,
vimrc file to use the package:,,,,
,,,,
"packadd! dvorak		"""" Dvorak keyboard support; adds mappings",,,,
,,,,
"packadd! editexisting	"""" when editing a file that is already edited with",,,,
"			"""" another Vim instance", go to that Vim instance,,,
,,,,
"packadd! justify	"""" justifying text",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Getting started:,,,,
,,,,
type,,,,
in your shell:	 vim urm<RETURN>,,,,
in vim:		 :so urm,,,,
 The URM,,,,
concept is used in theoretical computer science to aid in theorem proving,,,,
  A dot marks the end of a program,,,,
 (Bug: there must be a space,,,,
after the dot,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Commands:,,,,
a<n>		increment register <n>,,,,
s<n>		decrement register <n>,,,,
<x>;<y>		execute command <x> and then <y>,,,,
(<x>)<n>	execute command <x> while register <n> is nonzero,,,,
,,,,

obs-studio,", 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it
 (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead


When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code


Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software
 If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations


Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents


GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0
 The ""Program"", below, refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program"" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ""modification""
) Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope


1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License


c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License
 (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement
 But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program


3
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code
 (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
 However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code


4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance


5
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works
 These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
 Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it


6
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License


7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License
 If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all
 For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances
 Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded
 In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
 If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation
 If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation


10
 For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this
 Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


NO WARRANTY

11
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
 SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
 By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
 This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it


For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights
 To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


2
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License
 For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable
 You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices


8


9
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES





















",") You can apply it to your programs, too


To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights


We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software
 We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary


The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow
 The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)
 If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it",

Tutor is a ""hands on"" tutorial for new users of the Vim editor


Most new users can get through it in less than one hour
 You can simply
execute ""vim tutor"" and then follow the instructions in the lessons

The lessons tell you to modify the file, so DON'T DO THIS ON YOUR
ORIGINAL COPY


On Unix you can also use the ""vimtutor"" program
  It will make a
scratch copy of the tutor first


I have considered adding more advanced lessons but have not found the
time
 Please let me know how you like it and send any improvements you
make

The tutor
xx and tutor
utf-8 files are translated files (where xx is the
language code)
  The encoding of tutor
xx might be latin1 or other traditional
encoding
  If you don't need a translation with such traditional encoding,
you just need to prepare the tutor
xx

If you need another encoding, you can also prepare a file named tutor
xx
vim file
xx from tutor
  (For some languages, tutor
utf-8 is created
from tutor
)

Translation
-----------

The tutor
xx and tutor
xx
utf-8 files are translated files (where xx is the
language code)
  The encoding of tutor
xx might be latin1 or other traditional
encoding
  If you don't need a translation with such traditional encoding,
you just need to prepare the tutor
xx
enc
(replace enc with the actual encoding name)
  You might also need to adjust the
tutor

The ""make"" command can be used for creating tutor
