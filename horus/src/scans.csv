		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


  4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance


  5
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License


  7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License


  10
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this


			    NO WARRANTY

  11
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does


    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc
,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA


If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker
  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library
  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License
NET][dotnet] that runs
on Windows, macOS, and Linux

Compare to Git's [built-in credential helpers][git-tools-credential-storage]

provide single-factor authentication support for username/password only
NET Framework-based

  The initial major version of Git is not supported or tested with GCM


- Git 2

  This version of Git introduced a breaking change with parsing credential
  configuration that GCM relies on
 This issue was fixed in commit

## How to use

Once it's installed and configured, Git Credential Manager is called implicitly
by Git
 You don't have to do anything special, and GCM isn't intended to be
called directly by the user
 (This
process will look slightly different for each Git host, and even in some cases,
whether you've connected to an on-premises or cloud-hosted Git host
) Later Git
commands in the same repository will re-use existing credentials or tokens that
GCM has stored for as long as they're valid

# Git Large File Storage

com/git-lfs/git-lfs/actions?query=workflow%3ACI

[Git LFS](https://git-lfs
github
md) for managing large files with Git
 Check out the [website](http://git-lfs
github


* **Linux users**
 Debian and RPM packages are available from
  [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud
sh) bottles are distributed, and can
  be installed via `brew install git-lfs`
org/)
 Alternatively, you can
  install a recent version of Git LFS from the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey
org/) package manager

* **Binary packages**
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases) are
available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD

* **Building from source**
 [This repository](https://github
git) can also be
built from source using the latest version of [Go](https://golang
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation#source)


Note that Debian and RPM packages are built for all OSes for amd64 and i386

For arm64, only Debian packages for the latest Debian release are built due to the cost of building in emulation


### Installing

#### From binary

The [binary packages](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases) include a script which will:

- Install Git LFS binaries onto the system `$PATH`
- Run `git lfs install` to
perform required global configuration changes


```ShellSession
$ 
/install
sh
```

#### From source

- Ensure you have the latest version of Go, GNU make, and a standard Unix-compatible build environment installed

- On Windows, install `goversioninfo` with `go install github
com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo/cmd/goversioninfo@latest`

- Git LFS requires global configuration changes once per-machine
 This can be done by
running:

```ShellSession
$ git lfs install
```

#### Verifying releases

Releases are signed with the OpenPGP key of one of the core team members
  To
get these keys, you can run the following command, which will print them to
standard output:

```ShellSession
$ curl -L https://api
github
com/repos/git-lfs/git-lfs/tarball/core-gpg-keys | tar -Ozxf -
```

Once you have the keys, you can download the `sha256sums
10
0
tar
gz | shasum -a 256 -c
```

For the convenience of distributors, we also provide a wider variety of signed
hashes in the `hashes
asc` file
  Those hashes are in the tagged BSD format, but
can be verified with Perl's `shasum` or the GNU hash utilities, just like the
ones in `sha256sums
asc`


## Example Usage

To begin using Git LFS within a Git repository that is not already configured
for Git LFS, you can indicate which files you would like Git LFS to manage

This can be done by running the following _from within a Git repository_:

```bash
$ git lfs track ""*
psd""
```

(Where `*
psd` is the pattern of filenames that you wish to track
com/docs/gitattributes))


> *Note:* the quotation marks surrounding the pattern are important to
> prevent the glob pattern from being expanded by the shell


After any invocation of `git-lfs-track(1)` or `git-lfs-untrack(1)`, you _must
commit changes to your `
psd files using Git LFS""
```

You can now interact with your Git repository as usual, and Git LFS will take
care of managing your large files
psd
$ git commit -m ""add psd""
```

> _Tip:_ if you have large files already in your repository's history, `git lfs
> track` will _not_ track them retroactively
 For example:
>
> ```
> $ git lfs migrate import --include=""*
psd"" --everything
> ```
>
> **Note that this will rewrite history and change all of the Git object IDs in your
> repository, just like the export version of this command
**
>
> For more information, read [`git-lfs-migrate(1)`](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-migrate
adoc)


You can confirm that Git LFS is managing your PSD file:

```bash
$ git lfs ls-files
3c2f7aedfb * my
2 KB/s
# 



To https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs-test
   67fcf6a

47b2002  main -> main
```

Note: Git LFS requires at least Git 1
8
2 on Linux or 1
8
5 on macOS


### Uninstalling

If you've decided that Git LFS isn't right for you, you can convert your
repository back to a plain Git repository with `git lfs migrate` as well
  For
example:

```ShellSession
$ git lfs migrate export --include=""*
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Limitations)


Git LFS source code utilizes Go modules in its build system, and therefore this
project contains a `go
mod` file with a defined Go module path
  However, we
do not maintain a stable Go language API or ABI, as Git LFS is intended to be
used solely as a compiled binary utility


## Need Help?

You can get help on specific commands directly:

```bash
$ git lfs help <subcommand>
```

The [official documentation](docs) has command references and specifications for
the tool
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-faq


If you have a question on how to use Git LFS, aren't sure about something, or
are looking for input from others on tips about best practices or use cases,
feel free to
[start a discussion](https://github


You can always [open an issue](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues), and
one of the Core Team members will respond to you
 The output of `git lfs env`, which displays helpful information about your
   Git repository useful in debugging

2
 Any failed commands re-run with `GIT_TRACE=1` in the environment, which
   displays additional information pertaining to why a command crashed

VIM LICENSE

I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
    that they must include this license text


II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This license text must be included unmodified

    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
	  the distribution how to contact you
  What the
	  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
	  will be distributed is negotiable

	  The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim
  If this
	  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
	  vim
org and/or comp
  When it is completely
	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
	  your changes ceases
  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again

       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
	  unmodified, as mentioned at I)
  If you make additional changes the
	  text under a) applies to those changes

       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
	  the modified Vim you distribute
  You can choose what license to use for new code you
	  add
  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim

	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim
  When the maintainer
	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
	    available to him

	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you
  This
	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
	    as possible

       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
	  any later version

    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections


III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code

     If the number of changes is small (e
g
, a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
     context diff will do

IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
     sources, parts of it or from a modified version

- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible


- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits
  further distribution to the GNU GPL


- If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and
  contact information with the ""--with-modified-by"" configure argument or the

Kibaale Children's Centre		*kcc* *Kibaale*  *charity*

Kibaale Children's Centre (KCC) is located in Kibaale, a small town in the
south of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa
  Although people are poor, there
usually is enough food
  But this district is suffering from AIDS more than
any other part of the world
  Estimations are
that in the past 10 to 30% of the Ugandans are infected with HIV
  Because
parents die, there are many orphans


The children need a lot of help
  The KCC is working hard to provide the needy
with food, medical care and education
  Food and medical care to keep them
healthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the
future
  KCC works on a Christian base, but help is given to children of any
religion
  This has been
neglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil
wars
  There is
also help for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal is to
prevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food


Most of the orphans are living in an extended family
  An uncle or older
sister is taking care of them
  Clothes, medical
care and schooling is beyond its reach
  A child can be financially adopted


Besides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up
needs to be improved
  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods

There is a demonstration school at the centre and teacher trainings are given
  I helped setting up a
production site for cement slabs
  These are used to build a good latrine
  Since 2020 a maternity ward was added and 24/7 service is
available
  Immunization
programs are carried out and help is provided when an epidemic is breaking out
(measles and cholera have been a problem)

							*donate*
Summer 1994 to summer 1995 I spent a whole year at the centre, working as a
volunteer
  I have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water
and sanitation
  I learned that the help that the KCC provides really helps

When I came back to Holland, I wanted to continue supporting KCC
  To do this
I'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program
  Sponsor a child in primary school: 17 euro a month (or more)

2
  Sponsor a child in secondary school: 25 euro a month (or more)

3
  Sponsor the clinic: Any amount a month or quarter
4
  A one-time donation

Compared with other organizations that do child sponsorship the amounts are
very low
  This is because the money goes directly to the centre
  Less than
5% is used for administration
  I trust the people that are working
at the centre, I know them personally
  The centre is
visited about once a year to check the progress (at our own cost)
  I have
visited the centre myself many times, starting in 1993
  The visit reports are
on the ICCF web site


If you have any further questions, send me e-mail: <Bram@vim

  They will be loaded

The colorschemes were updated for the Vim 9 release
  If you don't like the
changes you can find the old ones here:
https://github
 Define a new Normal color and set the 'background' option accordingly
 >

	set background={light or dark}
	highlight clear
	highlight Normal 


	




2
 >

	highlight clear Normal
	set background&
	highlight clear
	if &background == ""light""
	  highlight Error 


	  



	else
	  highlight Error 




	endif

You can use `:highlight clear` to reset everything to the defaults, and then
change the groups that you want differently

Note that `:highlight clear` uses the value of 'background', thus set it
before this command
, bold) might be set in the defaults that you want
removed in your color scheme
  Use something like ""gui=NONE"" to remove the
attributes


In case you want to set 'background' depending on the colorscheme selected,
this autocmd might be useful: >

     autocmd SourcePre */colors/blue_sky
vim set background=dark

Replace ""blue_sky"" with the name of the colorscheme


In case you want to tweak a colorscheme after it was loaded, check out the
ColorScheme autocommand event


To clean up just before loading another colorscheme, use the ColorSchemePre
autocommand event
  For example: >

	let g:term_ansi_colors = 
g
vim/colors/mine
vim"",
and use "":runtime"" to load the original colorscheme: >

	"" load the ""evening"" colorscheme
	runtime colors/evening


You can use "":highlight"" to find out the current colors
  Exception: the
ctermfg and ctermbg values are numbers, which are only valid for the current
terminal
  See
`:help cterm-colors` 


The default color settings can be found in the source file src/syntax
c

Search for ""highlight_init""


If you think you have a color scheme that is good enough to be used by others,
please check the following items:

- Source the $VIMRUNTIME/colors/tools/check_colors
vim script to check for
  common mistakes


- Does it work in a color terminal as well as in the GUI? Is it consistent?

- Is ""g:colors_name"" set to a meaningful value?  In case of doubt you can do
  it this way: >

  	let g:colors_name = expand('<sfile>:t:r')

- Is 'background' either used or appropriately set to ""light"" or ""dark""?

- Try setting 'hlsearch' and searching for a pattern, is the match easy to
  spot?

- Split a window with "":split"" and "":vsplit""
  Are the status lines and
  vertical separators clearly visible?

- In the GUI, is it easy to find the cursor, also in a file with lots of
  syntax highlighting?

- In general, test your color scheme against as many filetypes, Vim features,
  environments, etc


- Do not use hard coded escape sequences, these will not work in other
  terminals
  Always use #RRGGBB for the GUI
  Names are more portable
  than numbers, though


- When targetting 256 colors terminals, prefer colors 16-255 to colors 0-15
  for the same reason

  universally supported
  Don't count on any of them
com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate)
  It is therefore highly
recommended


If you would like your color scheme to be distributed with Vim, make sure
that:

- it satisfies the guidelines above,
- it was made with colortemplate,

vim: set ft=help :



This directory contains Vim scripts to be used with a specific compiler

They are used with the "":compiler"" command


These scripts usually set options, for example 'errorformat'

See "":help write-compiler-plugin""




The ftplugin directory is for Vim plugin scripts that are only used for a
specific filetype

For example, these are all loaded for the ""c"" filetype:

	c
vim
	c/settings
vim

Note that the ""_"" in ""c_extra


The filetype plugins are only loaded when the "":filetype plugin"" command has
been used


The default filetype plugin files contain settings that 95% of the users will
want to use
  They do not contain personal preferences, like the value of
'shiftwidth'


If you want to do additional settings, or overrule the default filetype
plugin, you can create your own plugin file
  Looking at the existing files should give you
inspiration


If you have remarks about an existing file, send them to the maintainer of
that file
  Only when you get no response send a message to Bram@vim
org

	if exists(""b:did_indent"")
	  finish
	endif
	let b:did_indent = 1

Always use "":setlocal"" to set 'indentexpr'
  This avoids it being carried over
to other buffers


You normally set 'indentexpr' to evaluate a function and then define that
function
  That function only needs to be defined once for as long as Vim is
running
  Add a test if the function exists and use "":finish"", like this:
	if exists(""*GetMyIndent"")
	  finish
	endif

The user may have several options set unlike you, try to write the file such
that it works with any option settings
  Also be aware of certain features not
being compiled in


To test the indent file, see testdir/README
txt



keymap files for Vim

One of these files is loaded when the 'keymap' option is set


The name of the file consists of these parts:

	{language}[-{layout}][_{encoding}]
vim

{language}	Name of the language (e


{encoding}	Optional: character encoding for which this keymap works

		When omitted the ""normal"" encoding for the language is
		assumed


Each file starts with a header, naming the maintainer and the date when it was
last changed
  If you find a problem in a keymap file, check if you have the
most recent version























































Language files for Vim: Translated menus

The contents of each menu file is a sequence of lines with ""menutrans""
commands
  Read one of the existing files to get an idea of how this works


More information in the on-line help:

	:help multilang-menus
	:help :menutrans
	:help 'langmenu'
	:help :language

The ""$VIMRUNTIME/menu
vim"" file will search for a menu translation file
  This
depends on the value of the ""v:lang"" variable
 ""


The file name is always lower case
  It is the full name as the "":language""
command shows (the LC_MESSAGES value)
950

and use the menu translation file:

	$VIMRUNTIME/lang/menu_chinese(taiwan)_taiwan
950
Big5""
	sh/bash/ksh:	export LANG=""zh_TW
Big5""

and the menu translation file is:

	$VIMRUNTIME/lang/menu_zh_tw
big5
vim

The menu translation file should set the ""did_menu_trans"" variable so that Vim
will not load another file

For UTF-8 menu files which only use latin1 characters, you can rely on Vim
doing the conversion
  Let the UTF-8 menu file source the latin1 menu file,
and put ""scriptencoding latin1"" in that one

The macros in the maze, hanoi and urm directories can be used to test Vim for
vi compatibility

life	Macros that run Conway's game of life

urm	Macros that simulate a simple computer: ""Universal Register Machine""



The other files contain some handy utilities
  They also serve as examples for
how to use Vi and Vim functionality

sh + less
vim	make Vim work like less (or more)



The following have been moved to an optional package

The URM macro package was written by Rudolf Koenig (""Rudi"")
(rudolf@koeniglich
de) for hpux-vi in August 1991
vim<RETURN>
in vim:		 *	(to load the registers and boot the URM-machine :-)
in vim:		 g	(for 'go') and watch the fun
 Per default, 3 and 4
			are multiplied
 Watch the Program counter, it is
			visible as a komma moving around


This is a ""standard URM"" (Universal register machine)  interpreter

Here it proves that vim is a general problem solver (if you bring enough
patience)


The interpreter begins with register 1 (not 0), without macros and more-lines
capability
)

The registers are the first few lines, beginning with a '>' 

The program is the first line after the registers

You should always initialize the registers required by the program


Output register:	line 2
Input registers:	line 2 to 


 		(""dot blank"")  halt the machine


Examples:

Add register 2 to register 3:
	(a2;s3)3

Multiply register 2 with register 3:
	(a4;a5;s2)2; ((a2;s4)4; s3; (a1;a4;s5)5; (a5;s1)1)3


There are more (complicated) examples in the file examples

 Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2
2 or v3
x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated


 HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like
 a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make
 their preferences known
 In particular, if you trust me to make that
 decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something
 like

	This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version
	at the discretion of Linus
,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software
  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee


  2


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it


  6
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


  8
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time
  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns

[Git Credential Manager][gcm] (GCM) is a secure
[Git credential helper][git-credential-helper] built on [


GCM supports (in alphabetical order) [Azure DevOps][azure-devops], Azure DevOps

## Install

See the [installation instructions][install] for the current version of GCM for
install options for your operating system


## Current status

Git Credential Manager is currently available for Windows, macOS, and Linux\*

GCM only works with HTTP(S) remotes; you can still use Git with SSH:

## Supported Git versions

Git Credential Manager tries to be compatible with the broadest set of Git
versions (within reason)
 However there are some know problematic releases of
Git that are not compatible
26
 For example, when pushing (`git push`) to
[Azure DevOps][azure-devops], [Bitbucket][bitbucket], or [GitHub][github], a
window will automatically open and walk you through the sign-in process

for an overview of features


## Getting Started

### Downloading

You can install the Git LFS client in several different ways, depending on your
setup and preferences
io/github/git-lfs/install)

* **macOS users**
 [Homebrew](https://brew
 In addition, [binary packages](https://github
org), and the
available instructions in our
[Wiki](https://github
asc` file and verify
the file you want like so:

```ShellSession
$ gpg -d sha256sums
asc | grep git-lfs-linux-amd64-v2
 You can read
more about this pattern syntax
[here](https://git-scm
gitattributes` file_
gitattributes
$ git commit -m ""track *
 For example, changing a file named `my
psd`
(tracked above via `*
 To migrate existing large files
> in your history to use Git LFS, use `git lfs migrate`
psd"" --everything
```

**Note that this will rewrite history and change all of the Git object IDs in your
repository, just like the import version of this command


## Limitations

Git LFS maintains a list of currently known limitations, which you can find and
edit [here](https://github
  Please do not import the `git-lfs`
module into other Go code and do not rely on it as a source code dependency
  There's also a [FAQ](https://github
adoc)
shipped with Git LFS which answers some common questions

  Vim sponsors can vote for
features
  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
    include this license text
  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Vim scripts
org>
net, www
vim

       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
	    version of Vim without fee or restriction

    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the "":version""
       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
       is able to see that it was modified
  When distributing as mentioned
       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
       not conflict with the license used for the changes
  The preferred way to do this is
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL


=== end of license ===

Note:

- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this
  file and consider helping needy children in Uganda

  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not
  make a difference
  Also when you didn't actually change
  anything in Vim


- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all
  further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license
  The area is known as Rakai
District
  The population is mostly farmers
  Some say that it started there
  In this district about 60,000 children
have lost one or both parents, out of a population of 350,000
  Now that the government is stable again, the children and parents have
to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections
  Because these families are big and the income
(if any) is low, a child is lucky if it gets healthy food
  To help these needy children, a
sponsorship program was put into place

For a few dollars a month KCC sees to it that the child gets indispensable
items, is healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that
needs to be done for the child and the family that supports it

Health workers are being trained, hygiene education is carried out and
households are stimulated to build a proper latrine

They are sold below cost price


There is a clinic at the project, which provides children and their family
medical help
  When needed, transport to a hospital is offered
  This is possible because this is a small
organization that works with volunteers
  If you would like to sponsor a
child, you should have the intention to do this for at least one year

personal guarantee as the author of Vim

README
txt for color scheme files

These files are used for the `:colorscheme` command
  They appear in the
""Edit/Color Scheme"" menu in the GUI
com/vim/colorschemes/tree/master/legacy_colors


Hints for writing a color scheme file:

There are two basic ways to define a color scheme:

1
 Use the default Normal color and automatically adjust to the value of
   'background'

  This will also work for groups
that are added in later versions of Vim

Some attributes (e
g

	augroup MyColorscheme
	  au!
	  au ColorSchemePre * unlet g:term_ansi_colors
	  au ColorSchemePre * au! MyColorscheme
	augroup END

To customize a colorscheme use another name, e
  ""~/
vim
	"" change the color of statements
	hi Statement ctermfg=Blue guifg=Blue

To see which highlight group is used where, see `:help highlight-groups` and
`:help group-name` 
  Use the color names instead for better portability
 as possible


- Is ""g:terminal_ansi_colors"" set to a list of 16 #RRGGBB values?

- Try to keep your color scheme simple by avoiding unnecessary logic and
  refraining from adding options
  The best color scheme is one that only
  requires: >

  	colorscheme foobar

The color schemes distributed with Vim are built with lifepillar/colortemplate
(https://github


If you want to write your own compiler plugin, have a look at the other files
for how to do it, the format is simple


If you think a compiler plugin you have written is useful for others, please
send it to Bram@vim
vim in this directory and subdirectories will be sourced
by Vim when it detects the filetype that matches the name of the file or
subdirectory
vim
	c_extra
vim"" is required to separate the filetype name
from the following arbitrary name
  See "":help ftplugin"" in Vim





This directory contains files to automatically compute the indent for a
type of file


If you want to add your own indent file for your personal use, read the docs
at "":help indent-expression""


If you make a new indent file which would be useful for others, please send it
to Bram@vim
org

And please stick to the rules below
org


If you are the maintainer of an indent file and make improvements, e-mail the
new version to Bram@vim



Rules for making an indent file:

You should use this check for ""b:did_indent"":

	"" Only load this indent file when no other was loaded yet
g
, ""hebrew"", ""greek"")

{layout}	Optional: name of the keyboard layout (e
g
  When omitted the layout of the standard
		US-english keyboard is assumed
  If necessary, report a problem to the maintainer


The format of the keymap lines below ""loadkeymap"" is explained in the Vim help
files, see "":help keymap-file-format""
 v:lang 
vim""

When the 'menutrans' option is set, its value will be used instead of v:lang


For example, to use the Big5 (Taiwan) menus on MS-Windows the $LANG will be

	Chinese(Taiwan)_Taiwan
vim

On Unix you should set $LANG, depending on your shell:

	csh/tcsh:	setenv LANG ""zh_TW



AUTOMATIC CONVERSION

When Vim was compiled with multi-byte support, conversion between latin1 and
UTF-8 will always be possible
  Other conversions depend on the iconv
library, which is not always available
, between iso-8859-# and
MS-Windows codepages), thus the converted menu file must be available

	press ""g""

To prove that you can do anything in vi, I wrote a couple of macros that
allows vi to solve mazes

				"
obs-studio,", 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it
 (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead


When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code


Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software
 If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations


Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents


GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0
 The ""Program"", below, refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program"" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ""modification""
) Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope


1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License


c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License
 (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement
 But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program


3
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code
 (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
 However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code


4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance


5
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works
 These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
 Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it


6
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License


7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License
 If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all
 For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances
 Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded
 In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
 If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation
 If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation


10
 For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this
 Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


NO WARRANTY

11
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
 SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION


12","































































GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
 By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
 This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it


For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights
 To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


2
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License
 For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable
 You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices


8


9
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES





















",") You can apply it to your programs, too


To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights


We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software
 We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary


The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow
 The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)
 If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it"

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc


Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it
 By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
 (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead
) You can apply it to your programs, too


When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things
 If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations
 We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary
 To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow
 The ""Program"", below, refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program"" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope
 The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


1


2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License
 If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works
 But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code
 (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
 For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable
 However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code


4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works
 Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it


6
 You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License


7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License
 For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded


9
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
 If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation
 For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this
 Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


NO WARRANTY

11
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
 SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION


12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES





















"," This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it


To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights


For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code


We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software


Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software


Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents


GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License
) Each licensee is addressed as ""you""
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole


3
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it


5
 These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances
 Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice


8
 In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns
 If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation


10",", 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ""modification""


c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License
 (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement
 If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission"

 You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License
 Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3
1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License
 Distribution of a Larger Work

Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s)

You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer
 You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction

Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance
2
 If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2
1 of this License shall terminate

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc

     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program


  2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code


  4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License


  5
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it


  6


  7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


  8
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time
  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this


			    NO WARRANTY

  11
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION


  12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


  To do so, attach the following notices to the program
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does


    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details


If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker
  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General

NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind

c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it
c for full details
c is
not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not
limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do

The same holds for its supporting scripts (config

ltconfig, ltmain
  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M

  For this
reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
JPEG software
 (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
implementations will support it
) So far as we are aware, there are
no patent restrictions on the remaining code


The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files

To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
produce ""uncompressed GIFs""

### LGPL 2
1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc

 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL
]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it


  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it
  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it
  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it
  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights


  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library


  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program


  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License
  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License
  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library
  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries


  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard
  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library
  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries
  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License
  Pay close attention to the difference between a
""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library""
  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run


                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called ""this License"")
  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library


  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope


  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee


  2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library


    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License


    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful


    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
 You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library
  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License


  4
 You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange


  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code


  5
 A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library""


  However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that uses the
library""
  The executable is therefore covered by this License

Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library


  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work

Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself


  6


  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License
  You must supply a copy of this License
  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License
  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions
)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library


    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place


    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy
  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable
  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute
  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above


  8
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License
  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License


  9
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it


  10
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License


  11
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  13
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation


  14
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission
  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally
 BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU


  16
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES


                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change
  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License)


  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library
  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2
1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version
  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details


    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc
, 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the library, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project
  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least
  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works
  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code
 (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products

  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project



  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license

   """"""

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use

      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution


    o freetype-devel@nongnu
freetype


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary
  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License


  9
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation


  10
  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE

    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc
, 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs
  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library

                       Version 2
  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2
1
  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code
  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder
  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license


  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library
  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom


  We call this license the ""Lesser"" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License
  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs
  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances


  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software


  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library

Each licensee is addressed as ""you""
  A ""work based on the
Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language
)

  ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it)
  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library
  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish
)  Do not make any other change in
these notices


  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy


  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library
  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License

Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables


  When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not
)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6
 As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications
  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ""work that
    uses the Library"", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library
  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with


    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution


  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system


  7


    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work
  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License


  12

Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns
  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation
  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this


                            NO WARRANTY

  PURPOSE
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License
)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY

  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things


  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you


  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library
  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others
  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs
  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow


  A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables


  The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms
  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term ""modification""
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it
  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law
  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6


  For an executable, the required form of the ""work that uses the
Library"" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it
 You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities
 Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions
 If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License

  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
  this software without specific prior written permission

allows flexible cryptographic key strength to be configured via the
jurisdiction policy files which are referenced by the ""crypto


By default, Java provides two different sets of cryptographic policy
files:

    unlimited:  These policy files contain no restrictions on cryptographic
                strengths or algorithms

    limited:    These policy files contain more restricted cryptographic
                strengths

These files reside in <java-home>/conf/security/policy in the ""unlimited""

Each subdirectory contains a complete policy configuration,
and subdirectories can be added/edited/removed to reflect your
import or export control product requirements


Within a subdirectory, the effective policy is the combined minimum
permissions of the grant statements in the file(s) matching the filename
pattern ""default_*

  For example:

    limited   =  Export (all) + Import (limited)  =  Limited
    unlimited =  Export (all) + Import (all)      =  Unlimited

The effective exemption policy is the combined minimum permissions
of the grant statements in the file(s) matching the filename pattern
""exempt_*
  For example:

    limited   =  grants exemption permissions, by which the

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project


  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license
  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least


  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike
  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works
  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code
 (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products

  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project
  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """"""
    Portions of this software are copyright Â© <year> The FreeType
    Project (www
freetype
org)
  All rights reserved

   """"""

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use



Legal Terms

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'

  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'

  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this

   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the

  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory
   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it

  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms

     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope
  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)


  1


  2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code


  4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it


  6

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  8
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License


  9
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time
  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION


  12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


  To do so, attach the following notices to the program


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc
, 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi
  Hence arithmetic coding
cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses
  For this
reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
JPEG software
 (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
implementations will support it
  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm;
the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all
standard GIF decoders

   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages
 Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability
 While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License
 However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2
1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc

 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL
  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2
]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it


  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it
  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it


  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code
  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it


  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library
  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others
  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder
  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license


  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library
  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom
  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library


  We call this license the ""Lesser"" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License
  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs


  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard
  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library
  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries
  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License


  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow
  Pay close attention to the difference between a
""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library""
  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run


                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called ""this License"")

Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


  A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables
  A ""work based on the
Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language
)

  ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it


  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope
  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it)


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library


    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library
 You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library
  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License
  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish


  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy


  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library
 You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange


  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code


  5
 A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library""
  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License

Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables


  When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not

Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library


  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work
  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6
 As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications
  You must supply a copy of this License


    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution


    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy


  For an executable, the required form of the ""work that uses the
Library"" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it


  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system


  7
 You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities
  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above


  8


  9
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works


  11
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  12
 If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time

Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns
  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation
  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation
  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this


                            NO WARRANTY

  15
 BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU
  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION


  16


    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does
1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version


    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the library, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow
  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification""
)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you""

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License

 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License


  7
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances


Each version is given a distinguishing version number


  10
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found

  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price
  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights


  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library


  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program
  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License
  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs
  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances


  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software


  The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms
  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term ""modification""
  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library
  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does


  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee


  2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library


    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License


    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful
  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License
)  Do not make any other change in
these notices


  4
  The executable is therefore covered by this License
  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law

Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself


  6
  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License
  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions
)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library
  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with


    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place
  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable
  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License
  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License
  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License


  10
 Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances
  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License


  13


Each version is given a distinguishing version number


  14
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES


                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change
  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License)
  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found

In the case of the JRE & JDK runtimes, the terms of the Oracle license do
NOT apply to the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library; it is licensed under the
following license, separately from Oracle's JDK & JRE
openjdk
java


  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License
  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries
  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system


  3


  However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that uses the
library""
)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6


  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License
  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ""work that
    uses the Library"", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library


    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it
  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally


  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library

    for the Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment

                               README
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Import and export control rules on cryptographic software vary from
country to country
  The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) architecture
allows flexible cryptographic key strength to be configured via the
jurisdiction policy files which are referenced by the ""crypto


By default, Java provides two different sets of cryptographic policy
files:

    unlimited:  These policy files contain no restrictions on cryptographic
                strengths or algorithms

    limited:    These policy files contain more restricted cryptographic
                strengths

These files reside in <java-home>/conf/security/policy in the ""unlimited""
or ""limited"" subdirectories respectively


Each subdirectory contains a complete policy configuration,
and subdirectories can be added/edited/removed to reflect your
import or export control product requirements


Within a subdirectory, the effective policy is the combined minimum
permissions of the grant statements in the file(s) matching the filename
pattern ""default_*
policy""
  For example:

    limited   =  Export (all) + Import (limited)  =  Limited
    unlimited =  Export (all) + Import (all)      =  Unlimited

The effective exemption policy is the combined minimum permissions
of the grant statements in the file(s) matching the filename pattern
""exempt_*
  For example:

    limited   =  grants exemption permissions, by which the
                 effective policy can be circumvented
g


Please see the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) documentation for
additional information on these files and formats


YOU ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT YOUR EXPORT/IMPORT CONTROL COUNSEL OR ATTORNEY
TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS


Please note that the JCE for Java SE, including the JCE framework,
cryptographic policy files, and standard JCE providers provided with
the Java SE, have been reviewed and approved for export as mass market
encryption item by the US Bureau of Industry and Security

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project


  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license
  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least


  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike
  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works
 (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us
 (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software
  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code



  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license
  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """"""
    Portions of this software are copyright Â© <year> The FreeType
    Project (www
freetype
org)

   """"""

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use



Legal Terms
===========

0
 Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release

  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this


1
 No Warranty
--------------

  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE
  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT

TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation
   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
      files


    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation
  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory


  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files
  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us


3
 Advertising
--------------

  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission


  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'


  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it


4
 Contacts
-----------

  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

    o freetype@nongnu

      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation


    o freetype-devel@nongnu
org

      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
      specific licenses, porting, etc


  Our home page can be found at

    http://www
freetype
  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License
  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance


  5
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it


  6

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  8
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License


  9
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time
  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this
  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU


		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc
, 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if
necessary
  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi
  Hence arithmetic coding
cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses
  For this
reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
JPEG software


The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files

To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
produce ""uncompressed GIFs""

                       Version 2

 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed
  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2
]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it


  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code


  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library


  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program
  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder
  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license
  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License


  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library
  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom


  We call this license the ""Lesser"" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License
  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs
  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries
  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library
  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries
  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License


  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software


  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library
  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run


                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called ""this License"")

Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


  A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables
  A ""work based on the
Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language
  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term ""modification""
  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library


  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope
  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it)


  1


  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee


  2


    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License


    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful


    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application
  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots


  3
  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License
  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish
)  Do not make any other change in
these notices


  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library


  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code
 A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library""


  However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that uses the
library""
  The executable is therefore covered by this License

Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library
  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6
)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6
  You must supply a copy of this License
  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with


    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution


    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy
 You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities
  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License
  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License


  9
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it
 Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License


  11
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License
  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License


  13


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation


  14
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission
  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this


                            NO WARRANTY

  15

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE
  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION


  16
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES
  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License)


  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library
  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found
1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version


    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details


    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc
, 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the library, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification""

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


  2
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable


  4
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


Each version is given a distinguishing version number


  10
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


			    NO WARRANTY

  11
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION


  12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does


    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details


If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'

  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker
  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the

### LGPL 2
1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc


[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL
  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below
  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it
  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights
  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others


  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License
  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs
  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library
  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow
  Pay close attention to the difference between a
""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library""


  The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms
)

  ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License
 You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library


  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy
 You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange


  5
  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License

Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables


  When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not
  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law


  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work

Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself


  6
 As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications


  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License
  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License
  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ""work that
    uses the Library"", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library
  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions


    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place


  For an executable, the required form of the ""work that uses the
Library"" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it
  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable


  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system
  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute


  7


  8
  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices


  12
 If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded
  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation
  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally
 BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU


                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change
>

  All rights reserved except as
  specified below
   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License


  7
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation


  To do so, attach the following notices to the program


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it


  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library


  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard
  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works

ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance
 Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the

from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project


  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license
  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least


  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike
 However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports
 (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us
 (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software
  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code
 (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products

  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project
  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """"""
    Portions of this software are copyright Â© <year> The FreeType
    Project (www
  All rights reserved

   """"""

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use


  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'


  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive

  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this

 Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
      (`FTL

      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation
   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
      files
   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us
  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us

  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'
   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it

 Contacts

  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

    o freetype@nongnu
org

      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution


  Our home page can be found at

    http://www

     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed
  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all

  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee


  2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program


  3
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


  4
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance


  5
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works


  6
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License


  7
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License


  9
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation


  10
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


			    NO WARRANTY

  11
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does


    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if
necessary


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs

<pre>

Must reproduce following license in documentation and/or other materials
provided with distribution:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose


This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G
 Lane


Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute
this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee,
subject to these conditions:

(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed,
then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty
notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original
files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation


(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation
must state that ""this software is based in part on the work of the
Independent JPEG Group""


(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind


These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library
  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us


Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived
from it
  This software may be referred to only as ""the Independent JPEG
Group's software""


We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis
of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor



ansi2knr
c is included in this distribution by permission of L
 Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA
c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it

(See the file ansi2knr
c for full details
)  However, since ansi2knr


The Unix configuration script ""configure"" was produced with GNU Autoconf

It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable

The same holds for its supporting scripts (config
sub,
ltconfig, ltmain
  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M
I
T
 but is also freely distributable


It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi
  Hence arithmetic coding
cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses
  For this
reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
JPEG software


The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files
  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm;
the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all
standard GIF decoders


We are required to state that ""The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is
the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated
  GIF(sm) is a
Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated
""

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,

  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you
  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it
  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights


  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library
  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others


  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program
  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder
  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License
  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs


  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library
  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom


  We call this license the ""Lesser"" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License
  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries
  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances


  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard
  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library
  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries
  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License
  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system


  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow
  Pay close attention to the difference between a
""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library""
  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run


                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called ""this License"")


  The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms
  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term ""modification""


  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library


  2


    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License


    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
 You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library
  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish


  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code
 A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library""
  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License


  However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that uses the
library""
  The executable is therefore covered by this License

Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables


  When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not

Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library
  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6
)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6
 As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications


  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License
  You must supply a copy of this License
  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License


    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place


    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy


  For an executable, the required form of the ""work that uses the
Library"" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it
  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable
  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute


  7
  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above


    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work


  8
  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License


  9
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works


  10
 Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein


  11
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  12
 If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded


  13

Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission
  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this
  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally


                            NO WARRANTY

  15

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE


  16


                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change
  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License)


  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library
  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found


    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2


    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc
, 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the library, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc


			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License
  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification""
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  8
  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION


  12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms


  To do so, attach the following notices to the program
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details

  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker

  Additionally, subject to the terms and conditions of the
FreeType Project License, each contributor to the Work hereby grants

""Your"") a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,

Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code


  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library
  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license


  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License
  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library
  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs

Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


  A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables
  A ""work based on the
Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language
  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library
  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it)


  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee


    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful
  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots
  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License


  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy


  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library


  4
 You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange


  5

Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself


  6
  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions
  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with


    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution


  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system
 You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License
  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time
  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation
  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation


  14
 BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES
1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version


    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE

    Lesser General Public License for more details

### LGPL 2
]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below


  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software
)

  ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library
)  Do not make any other change in
these notices
  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law


  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work
  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ""work that
    uses the Library"", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library
)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License
  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU
  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION

  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License
)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope
  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee


  2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code


  4
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time
  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


			    NO WARRANTY

  11
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms


  To do so, attach the following notices to the program
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does


    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details
,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs
  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library
  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License


GCM replaces both the 
NET Framework-based
[Git Credential Manager for Windows][gcm-for-windows] and the Java-based
[Git Credential Manager for Mac and Linux][gcm-for-mac-and-linux]

GCM only works with HTTP(S) remotes; you can still use Git with SSH:

## Supported Git versions

Git Credential Manager tries to be compatible with the broadest set of Git
versions (within reason)
 However there are some know problematic releases of
Git that are not compatible


- Git 1


- Git 2
26
 This issue was fixed in commit
  [`12294990`][gcm-commit-12294990] of the Git project, and released in Git

0
 You don't have to do anything special, and GCM isn't intended to be
called directly by the user
 For example, when pushing (`git push`) to
[Azure DevOps][azure-devops], [Bitbucket][bitbucket], or [GitHub][github], a
window will automatically open and walk you through the sign-in process
 (This
process will look slightly different for each Git host, and even in some cases,
whether you've connected to an on-premises or cloud-hosted Git host
) Later Git
commands in the same repository will re-use existing credentials or tokens that
GCM has stored for as long as they're valid

[Git LFS](https://git-lfs


The client is written in Go, with pre-compiled binaries available for Mac,
Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD
 Check out the [website](http://git-lfs
github
com)
for an overview of features


## Getting Started

### Installing

#### On Linux

Debian and RPM packages are available from packagecloud, see the [Linux installation instructions](INSTALLING


#### On macOS

[Homebrew](https://brew


#### On Windows

Git LFS is included in the distribution of [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows

Alternatively, you can install a recent version of Git LFS from the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey
org/) package manager


#### From binary

[Binary packages](https://github

- Run `git lfs install` to perform required global configuration changes
/install

For arm64, only Debian packages are built and only for recent versions due to the cost of building in emulation

- On Windows, install `goversioninfo` with `go install github
com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo/cmd/goversioninfo@latest`

- Run `make`

- Place the `git-lfs` binary, which can be found in `bin`, on your systemâ€™s executable `$PATH` or equivalent

- Git LFS requires global configuration changes once per-machine
  To
get these keys, you can run the following command, which will print them to
standard output:

```ShellSession
$ curl -L https://api
github
asc` file and verify
the file you want like so:

```ShellSession
$ gpg -d sha256sums
0
tar
gz | shasum -a 256 -c
```

For the convenience of distributors, we also provide a wider variety of signed
hashes in the `hashes
asc` file
  Those hashes are in the tagged BSD format, but
can be verified with Perl's `shasum` or the GNU hash utilities, just like the
ones in `sha256sums
asc`


## Example Usage

To begin using Git LFS within a Git repository that is not already configured
for Git LFS, you can indicate which files you would like Git LFS to manage

This can be done by running the following _from within a Git repository_:

```bash
$ git lfs track ""*
psd""
```

(Where `*
com/docs/gitattributes))
gitattributes
$ git commit -m ""track *
psd files using Git LFS""
```

You can now interact with your Git repository as usual, and Git LFS will take
care of managing your large files
 For example:
>
> ```
> $ git lfs migrate import --include=""*
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-migrate
adoc)



To https://github

47b2002  main -> main
```

Note: Git LFS requires at least Git 1
8
5 on macOS


### Uninstalling

If you've decided that Git LFS isn't right for you, you can convert your
repository back to a plain Git repository with `git lfs migrate` as well
psd"" --everything
```

**Note that this will rewrite history and change all of the Git object IDs in your
repository, just like the import version of this command
**

If there's some reason that things aren't working out for you, please let us
know in an issue, and we'll definitely try to help or get it fixed


## Limitations

Git LFS maintains a list of currently known limitations, which you can find and
edit [here](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Limitations)


Git LFS source code utilizes Go modules in its build system, and therefore this
project contains a `go
mod` file with a defined Go module path
  However, we
do not maintain a stable Go language API or ABI, as Git LFS is intended to be
used solely as a compiled binary utility
  There's also a [FAQ](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-faq
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/discussions)
 The output of `git lfs env`, which displays helpful information about your
   Git repository useful in debugging
 Any failed commands re-run with `GIT_TRACE=1` in the environment, which
   displays additional information pertaining to why a command crashed

  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
encouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda
vim
org/iccf/
	https://www
iccf
  The money goes to Uganda anyway


The Open Publication License applies to the Vim documentation, see
|manual-copyright|
  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Vim scripts


II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This license text must be included unmodified
  The maintainer reserves the right to
	  include your changes in the official version of Vim
  What the
	  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
	  will be distributed is negotiable
  If there has been no negotiation
	  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes

	  The current maintainers are listed here: https://github
com/orgs/vim/people
vim
org and/or comp
  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again

       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
	  unmodified, as mentioned at I)
  If you make additional changes the
	  text under a) applies to those changes

       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
	  the modified Vim you distribute
  This may be done in the form of a
	  context diff
  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim
  When the maintainer
	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
	    available to him

	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you


III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code

     If the number of changes is small (e
, a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
     context diff will do
  The e-mail address to be used is
     <maintainer@vim
org>

IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
     sources, parts of it or from a modified version
  You may use this
     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came
     with, at your option
  The money goes to Uganda anyway


- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible

  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not
  make a difference


- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits
  further distribution to the GNU GPL


- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all
  further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license
  The area is known as Rakai
District
  The population is mostly farmers
  Estimations are
that in the past 10 to 30% of the Ugandans are infected with HIV
  Because
parents die, there are many orphans
  Although AIDS
is now mostly under control, the problems are still continuing


The children need a lot of help
  KCC works on a Christian base, but help is given to children of any
religion


The key to solving the problems in this area is education
  This has been
neglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil
wars
  Now that the government is stable again, the children and parents have
to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections


Most of the orphans are living in an extended family
  An uncle or older
sister is taking care of them
  Because these families are big and the income
(if any) is low, a child is lucky if it gets healthy food
  Clothes, medical
care and schooling is beyond its reach
  To help these needy children, a
sponsorship program was put into place

For a few dollars a month KCC sees to it that the child gets indispensable
items, is healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that
needs to be done for the child and the family that supports it

There is a demonstration school at the centre and teacher trainings are given

Health workers are being trained, hygiene education is carried out and
households are stimulated to build a proper latrine
  I helped setting up a
production site for cement slabs

They are sold below cost price


There is a clinic at the project, which provides children and their family
medical help
  Since 2020 a maternity ward was added and 24/7 service is
available
  Immunization
programs are carried out and help is provided when an epidemic is breaking out
(measles and cholera have been a problem)

							*donate*
Summer 1994 to summer 1995 I spent a whole year at the centre, working as a
volunteer
  I learned that the help that the KCC provides really helps

When I came back to Holland, I wanted to continue supporting KCC
  Please consider one
of these possibilities:

1
  Sponsor a child in secondary school: 25 euro a month (or more)

3
  Sponsor the clinic: Any amount a month or quarter
4
  A one-time donation

Compared with other organizations that do child sponsorship the amounts are
very low
  Less than
5% is used for administration
  This is possible because this is a small
organization that works with volunteers
  If you would like to sponsor a
child, you should have the intention to do this for at least one year
  I trust the people that are working
at the centre, I know them personally
  The centre is
visited about once a year to check the progress (at our own cost)
  The visit reports are
on the ICCF web site

README
  They appear in the
""Edit/Color Scheme"" menu in the GUI


The colorschemes were updated for the Vim 9 release
  If you don't like the
changes you can find the old ones here:
https://github
com/vim/colorschemes/tree/master/legacy_colors


Hints for writing a color scheme file:

There are two basic ways to define a color scheme:

1
 >

	set background={light or dark}
	highlight clear
	highlight Normal 



	



2
 Use the default Normal color and automatically adjust to the value of
   'background'


	  



  This will also work for groups
that are added in later versions of Vim

Note that `:highlight clear` uses the value of 'background', thus set it
before this command
  Use something like ""gui=NONE"" to remove the
attributes


In case you want to set 'background' depending on the colorscheme selected,
this autocmd might be useful: >

     autocmd SourcePre */colors/blue_sky


In case you want to tweak a colorscheme after it was loaded, check out the
ColorScheme autocommand event



	augroup MyColorscheme
	  au!
	  au ColorSchemePre * unlet g:term_ansi_colors
	  au ColorSchemePre * au! MyColorscheme
	augroup END

To customize a colorscheme use another name, e
  ""~/
vim/colors/mine
vim"",
and use "":runtime"" to load the original colorscheme: >

	"" load the ""evening"" colorscheme
	runtime colors/evening


You can use "":highlight"" to find out the current colors
  Use the color names instead for better portability
  See
`:help cterm-colors` 

Search for ""highlight_init""


If you think you have a color scheme that is good enough to be used by others,
please check the following items:

- Source the $VIMRUNTIME/colors/tools/check_colors
vim script to check for
  common mistakes


- Does it work in a color terminal as well as in the GUI? Is it consistent?

- Is ""g:colors_name"" set to a meaningful value?  In case of doubt you can do
  it this way: >

  	let g:colors_name = expand('<sfile>:t:r')

- Is 'background' either used or appropriately set to ""light"" or ""dark""?

- Try setting 'hlsearch' and searching for a pattern, is the match easy to
  spot?

- Split a window with "":split"" and "":vsplit""
 as possible


- Do not use hard coded escape sequences, these will not work in other
  terminals
  Always use #RRGGBB for the GUI


- When targeting 256 colors terminals, prefer colors 16-255 to colors 0-15
  for the same reason


- Typographic attributes (bold, italic, underline, reverse, etc
) are not
  universally supported
  The best color scheme is one that only
  requires: >

  	colorscheme foobar

The color schemes distributed with Vim are built with lifepillar/colortemplate
(https://github
  It is therefore highly
recommended


If you would like your color scheme to be distributed with Vim, make sure
that:

- it satisfies the guidelines above,
- it was made with colortemplate,

and join us at vim/colorschemes: (https://github
com/vim/colorschemes)

For example, these are all loaded for the ""c"" filetype:

	c
vim
	c_extra
vim

Note that the ""_"" in ""c_extra


The filetype plugins are only loaded when the "":filetype plugin"" command has
been used


The default filetype plugin files contain settings that 95% of the users will
want to use
  They do not contain personal preferences, like the value of
'shiftwidth'


If you want to do additional settings, or overrule the default filetype
plugin, you can create your own plugin file
  See "":help ftplugin"" in Vim





This directory contains files to automatically compute the indent for a
type of file


If you make a new indent file which would be useful for others, please send it
to the vim-dev mailing list <vim-dev@vim
org>
  Include instructions for
detecting the file type for this language, by file name extension or by
checking a few lines in the file
 And please stick to the rules below


If you have remarks about an existing file, send them to the maintainer of
that file
  Only when you get no response send a message to the vim-dev
mailing list: <vim-dev@vim
org>
org>

	if exists(""b:did_indent"")
	  finish
	endif
	let b:did_indent = 1

Always use "":setlocal"" to set 'indentexpr'
  This avoids it being carried over
to other buffers


You normally set 'indentexpr' to evaluate a function and then define that
function
  That function only needs to be defined once for as long as Vim is
running
  Add a test if the function exists and use "":finish"", like this:
	if exists(""*GetMyIndent"")
	  finish
	endif

The user may have several options set unlike you, try to write the file such
that it works with any option settings


To test the indent file, see testdir/README
txt
, ""hebrew"", ""greek"")

{layout}	Optional: name of the keyboard layout (e
, ""spanish"",
		""russian3"")
  When omitted the layout of the standard
		US-english keyboard is assumed


{encoding}	Optional: character encoding for which this keymap works


The format of the keymap lines below ""loadkeymap"" is explained in the Vim help
files, see "":help keymap-file-format""

























































Language files for Vim: Translated menus

The contents of each menu file is a sequence of lines with ""menutrans""
commands
  Read one of the existing files to get an idea of how this works
vim"" file will search for a menu translation file
  This
depends on the value of the ""v:lang"" variable


	""menu_"" 
 v:lang 
 ""
vim""

When the 'menutrans' option is set, its value will be used instead of v:lang


The file name is always lower case
  It is the full name as the "":language""
command shows (the LC_MESSAGES value)
950

and use the menu translation file:

	$VIMRUNTIME/lang/menu_chinese(taiwan)_taiwan
Big5""

and the menu translation file is:

	$VIMRUNTIME/lang/menu_zh_tw
big5
vim

The menu translation file should set the ""did_menu_trans"" variable so that Vim
will not load another file



AUTOMATIC CONVERSION

When Vim was compiled with multi-byte support, conversion between latin1 and
UTF-8 will always be possible
  Other conversions depend on the iconv
library, which is not always available

To run the maze macros with Vim:

	vim -u maze_mac maze_5

The macros in the maze, hanoi and urm directories can be used to test Vim for
vi compatibility
	The life macros can be used for performance comparisons


hanoi	Macros that solve the tower of hanoi problem

life	Macros that run Conway's game of life
  They also serve as examples for
how to use Vi and Vim functionality


less
  Add the command to your
vimrc file to use the package:

packadd! dvorak		"" Dvorak keyboard support; adds mappings

packadd! editexisting	"" when editing a file that is already edited with
			"" another Vim instance, go to that Vim instance

packadd! justify	"" justifying text


packadd! matchit	"" makes the % command work better

packadd! shellmenu	"" menus for editing shell scripts in the GUI version

packadd! swapmouse	"" swap left and right mouse buttons

This is another proof that Vim is perfectly compatible with Vi

The URM macro package was written by Rudolf Koenig (""Rudi"")
(rudolf@koeniglich
de) for hpux-vi in August 1991


Getting started:

type
in your shell:	 vim urm<RETURN>
in vim:		 :so urm
 Per default, 3 and 4
			are multiplied
 Watch the Program counter, it is
			visible as a comma moving around


This is a ""standard URM"" (Universal register machine)  interpreter
 The URM
concept is used in theoretical computer science to aid in theorem proving

Here it proves that vim is a general problem solver (if you bring enough
patience)
  A dot marks the end of a program
)

The registers are the first few lines, beginning with a '>' 

The program is the first line after the registers


Commands:
a<n>		increment register <n>
s<n>		decrement register <n>
<x>;<y>		execute command <x> and then <y>
(<x>)<n>	execute command <x> while register <n> is nonzero

 		(""dot blank"")  halt the machine


Examples:

Add register 2 to register 3:
	(a2;s3)3

















# EditorConfig Vim Plugin

[![Travis Build Status](https://img
shields
io/travis/cxw42/editorconfig-vim
shields
svg?logo=appveyor)](https://ci
appveyor
com/project/cxw42/editorconfig-vim)

This is an [EditorConfig][] plugin for Vim


## Installation

To install this plugin, you can use one of the following ways:

### Install with the archive

Download the [archive][] and extract it into your Vim runtime directory
(`~/
vim` on UNIX/Linux and `$VIM_INSTALLATION_FOLDER\vimfiles` on windows)


### Install as Vim8 plugin

Install as a Vim 8 plugin
 Note `local` can be any name, but some path
element must be present
 On Windows, instead of `~/
vim/pack/local/start
cd ~/
vim/pack/local/start
git clone https://github
com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim
git
```

### Install with [pathogen][]

Use pathogen (the git repository of this plugin is
https://github


### Install with [vim-plug][]

Use vim-plug by adding to your `
vimrc` in your plugin section:

```viml
Plug 'editorconfig/editorconfig-vim'
```

Source your `


Then call `:PlugInstall`
editorconfig` files
txt
*']
```

Of course these two items could be combined into the following:

```viml
let g:EditorConfig_exclude_patterns = ['fugitive://
*', 'scp://
  Therefore, you can disable the
plugin for all buffers of a specific filetype
 For example, to disable
EditorConfig for all git commit messages (filetype `gitcommit`):

```viml
au FileType gitcommit let b:EditorConfig_disable = 1
```

### Disable rules

In very rare cases,
you might need to override some project-specific EditorConfig rules in global
or local vimrc in some cases, e
g
  This is not recommended, but you can:

```viml
let g:EditorConfig_disable_rules = ['trim_trailing_whitespace']
```

You are able to disable any supported EditorConfig properties
 Be sure you have read the [contribution guidelines][]!

 But we can also just decide to synchronize and
  contact all copyright holders on record if/when the occasion arises


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification""

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein


  7
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


  8
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded


  9


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation


  10
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

Compare to Git's [built-in credential helpers][git-tools-credential-storage]
(Windows: wincred, macOS: osxkeychain, Linux: gnome-keyring/libsecret), which
provide single-factor authentication support for username/password only


## Install

See the [installation instructions][install] for the current version of GCM for
install options for your operating system


## Current status

Git Credential Manager is currently available for Windows, macOS, and Linux\*
x

  The initial major version of Git is not supported or tested with GCM
2

  This version of Git introduced a breaking change with parsing credential
  configuration that GCM relies on


## How to use

Once it's installed and configured, Git Credential Manager is called implicitly
by Git


## Experimental Features

- [Windows broker (experimental)][gcm-windows-broker]

## Future features

[specification](docs/spec
md) for managing large files with Git
md)
sh) bottles are distributed and can be installed via `brew install git-lfs`
org/)
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases) are
available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD
  On Windows in particular, you may need to restart your command shell so any change to `$PATH` will take effect and Git can locate the Git LFS binary
sh
```

Note that Debian and RPM packages are built for multiple Linux distributions and versions for both amd64 and i386
 This can be done by
running: `git lfs install`

#### Verifying releases

Releases are signed with the OpenPGP key of one of the core team members

psd` is the pattern of filenames that you wish to track
 You can read
more about this pattern syntax
[here](https://git-scm


> *Note:* the quotation marks surrounding the pattern are important to
> prevent the glob pattern from being expanded by the shell


After any invocation of `git-lfs-track(1)` or `git-lfs-untrack(1)`, you _must
commit changes to your `
gitattributes` file_
 This can be done by running:

```bash
$ git add 
 For example, changing a file named `my
psd`):

```bash
$ git add my
psd
$ git commit -m ""add psd""
```

> _Tip:_ if you have large files already in your repository's history, `git lfs
> track` will _not_ track them retroactively


You can confirm that Git LFS is managing your PSD file:

```bash
$ git lfs ls-files
3c2f7aedfb * my
psd
```

Once you've made your commits, push your files to the Git remote:

```bash
$ git push origin main

2 on Linux or 1
  Please do not import the `git-lfs`
module into other Go code and do not rely on it as a source code dependency


## Need Help?

You can get help on specific commands directly:

```bash
$ git lfs help <subcommand>
```

The [official documentation](docs) has command references and specifications for
the tool
adoc)
shipped with Git LFS which answers some common questions


If you have a question on how to use Git LFS, aren't sure about something, or
are looking for input from others on tips about best practices or use cases,
feel free to
[start a discussion](https://github


You can always [open an issue](https://github
com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues), and

  When it is completely
	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
	  your changes ceases
  You can choose what license to use for new code you

	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
	    version of Vim without fee or restriction

	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim
  This
	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
	    as possible

    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the "":version""
       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
       is able to see that it was modified

       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
       not conflict with the license used for the changes

    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections

Kibaale Children's Centre		*kcc* *Kibaale*  *charity*

Kibaale Children's Centre (KCC) is located in Kibaale, a small town in the
south of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa
  Although people are poor, there
usually is enough food
  Some say that it started there
  In this district about 60,000 children
have lost one or both parents, out of a population of 350,000
  Food and medical care to keep them
healthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the
future


Besides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up
needs to be improved
  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods
  These are used to build a good latrine
  I have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water
and sanitation
  To do this
I'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program

2
  This is because the money goes directly to the centre


How do you know that the money will be spent right?  First of all you have my
personal guarantee as the author of Vim
  I have
visited the centre myself many times, starting in 1993


The address of the centre is:
			Kibaale Children's Centre

  They take care of the

You can use `:highlight clear` to reset everything to the defaults, and then
change the groups that you want differently
, bold) might be set in the defaults that you want
removed in your color scheme
vim set background=dark

Replace ""blue_sky"" with the name of the colorscheme


To clean up just before loading another colorscheme, use the ColorSchemePre
autocommand event
  For example: >

	let g:term_ansi_colors = 
g
vim
	"" change the color of statements
	hi Statement ctermfg=Blue guifg=Blue

To see which highlight group is used where, see `:help highlight-groups` and
`:help group-name` 


The default color settings can be found in the source file src/syntax
c
  Are the status lines and
  vertical separators clearly visible?

- In the GUI, is it easy to find the cursor, also in a file with lots of
  syntax highlighting?

- In general, test your color scheme against as many filetypes, Vim features,
  environments, etc


- When targeting 8-16 colors terminals, don't count on ""darkblue"" to be blue
  and dark, or on ""2"" to be even vaguely reddish
  Names are more portable
  than numbers, though
com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate)

They are used with the "":compiler"" command


These scripts usually set options, for example 'errorformat'

See "":help write-compiler-plugin""


If you want to write your own compiler plugin, have a look at the other files
for how to do it, the format is simple


If you think a compiler plugin you have written is useful for others, please
send it to the vim-dev mailing list: <vim-dev@vim


All files ending in 
vim in this directory and subdirectories will be sourced
by Vim when it detects the filetype that matches the name of the file or
subdirectory

	c/settings
vim"" is required to separate the filetype name
from the following arbitrary name


If you want to add your own indent file for your personal use, read the docs
at "":help indent-expression""



Rules for making an indent file:

You should use this check for ""b:did_indent"":

	"" Only load this indent file when no other was loaded yet


To trigger the indenting after typing a word like ""endif"", add the word to the
'indentkeys' option with ""+=""
  Also be aware of certain features not
being compiled in



keymap files for Vim

One of these files is loaded when the 'keymap' option is set
vim

{language}	Name of the language (e
g
g

		When omitted the ""normal"" encoding for the language is
		assumed

		Use the value the 'encoding' option: lower case only, use '-'
		instead of '_'


Each file starts with a header, naming the maintainer and the date when it was
last changed
  If you find a problem in a keymap file, check if you have the
most recent version
  If necessary, report a problem to the maintainer


More information in the on-line help:

	:help multilang-menus
	:help :menutrans
	:help 'langmenu'
	:help :language

You can find a couple of helper tools for translating menus on github:
https://github
com/adaext/vim-menutrans-helper

The ""$VIMRUNTIME/menu


For example, to use the Big5 (Taiwan) menus on MS-Windows the $LANG will be

	Chinese(Taiwan)_Taiwan
950
vim

On Unix you should set $LANG, depending on your shell:

	csh/tcsh:	setenv LANG ""zh_TW
Big5""
	sh/bash/ksh:	export LANG=""zh_TW

For UTF-8 menu files which only use latin1 characters, you can rely on Vim
doing the conversion
  Let the UTF-8 menu file source the latin1 menu file,
and put ""scriptencoding latin1"" in that one
vimrc, which
may contain settings and mappings that get in the way

in vim:		 g	(for 'go') and watch the fun


The interpreter begins with register 1 (not 0), without macros and more-lines

You should always initialize the registers required by the program

[![Appveyor Build Status](https://img
io/appveyor/ci/cxw42/editorconfig-vim

You should have 4 sub-directories in this runtime directory now: ""autoload"",
""doc"", ""ftdetect"" and ""plugin""

```shell
mkdir -p ~/
com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim
git)

### Install with [Vundle][]

Use Vundle by adding to your `
vimrc` Vundle plugins section:

```viml
Plugin 'editorconfig/editorconfig-vim'
```

Then call `:PluginInstall`
vimrc` by calling `:source $MYVIMRC`


### No external editorconfig core library is required

Previous versions of this plugin also required a Python ""core""

The core included the code to parse `

This plugin **includes** the core, so you don't need to download the
core separately


## Supported properties

The EditorConfig Vim plugin supports the following EditorConfig [properties][]:

* `indent_style`
* `indent_size`
* `tab_width`
* `end_of_line`
* `charset`
* `insert_final_newline` (Feature `+fixendofline`, available on Vim 7
4
785+,
  or [PreserveNoEOL][] is required for this property)
* `trim_trailing_whitespace`
* `max_line_length`
* `root` (only used by EditorConfig core)

## Selected Options

The supported options are documented in [editorconfig
txt][]
and can be viewed by executing the following: `:help editorconfig`
*']
```

If you wanted to avoid loading EditorConfig for any remote files over ssh:

```viml
let g:EditorConfig_exclude_patterns = ['scp://
*']
```

### Disable for a specific filetype

You can disable this plugin for a specific buffer by setting
`b:EditorConfig_disable`
, to resolve conflicts of trailing whitespace
trimming and buffer autosaving

       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
