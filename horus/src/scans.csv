 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License
)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope
  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program


  2


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


  4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions


  7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  8
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time


Each version is given a distinguishing version number


  10
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


			    NO WARRANTY

  11
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION


  12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


  To do so, attach the following notices to the program
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version

    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE

    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs
  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library
  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License","
 Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2
2 or v3
 In particular, if you trust me to make that
 decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something
 like

	This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version
	at the discretion of Linus
 But we can also just decide to synchronize and
  contact all copyright holders on record if/when the occasion arises


			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary
  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification""


  1


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program


  5
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission


		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc


","x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated


 HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like
 a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make
 their preferences known

 OpenSSL 1


 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

 The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
 commercial-grade, fully featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the
 Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols (including SSLv3) as well as a
 full-strength general purpose cryptographic library
 Young
 and Tim J


 OVERVIEW
 --------

 The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

 libssl (with platform specific naming):
     Provides the client and server-side implementations for SSLv3 and TLS


 openssl:
     A command line tool that can be used for:
        Creation of key parameters
        Creation of X




 INSTALLATION
 ------------

 See the appropriate file:
        INSTALL         Linux, Unix, Windows, OpenVMS, 

        NOTES
*         INSTALL addendums for different platforms

 SUPPORT
 -------

 See the OpenSSL website www
openssl
openssl
org/community/mailinglists


 If you have any problems with OpenSSL then please take the following steps
 first:

    - Download the latest version from the repository
      to see if the problem has already been addressed
    - Configure with no-asm
    - Remove compiler optimization flags

 If you wish to report a bug then please include the following information
 and create an issue on GitHub:

    - OpenSSL version: output of 'openssl version -a'
    - Configuration data: output of 'perl configdata
pm --dump'
    - OS Name, Version, Hardware platform
    - Compiler Details (name, version)
    - Application Details (name, version)
    - Problem Description (steps that will reproduce the problem, if known)
    - Stack Traceback (if the application dumps core)

 Just because something doesn't work the way you expect does not mean it
 is necessarily a bug in OpenSSL
 If you
 are potentially subject to such restrictions you should seek competent
 professional legal advice before attempting to develop or distribute
 cryptographic code"," Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright

3 for AS400 installation instructions

I) From an AS400 *SAVF file:

1)      Unpacking archive to an AS400 save file

On the AS400:

_       Create the ZLIB AS400 library:

        CRTLIB LIB(ZLIB) TYPE(PROD) TEXT('ZLIB compression API library')

_       Create a work save file, for example:

                CRTSAVF FILE(ZLIB/ZLIBSAVF)

On a PC connected to the target AS400:

_       Unpack the save file image to a PC file ""ZLIBSAVF""
_       Upload this file into the save file on the AS400, for example
                using ftp in BINARY mode



2)      Populating the ZLIB AS400 source library

On the AS400:

_       Extract the saved objects into the ZLIB AS400 library using:

RSTOBJ OBJ(*ALL) SAVLIB(ZLIB) DEV(*SAVF) SAVF(ZLIB/ZLIBSAVF) RSTLIB(ZLIB)


3)      Customize installation:

_       Edit CL member ZLIB/TOOLS(COMPILE) and change parameters if needed,
                according to the comments


_       Compile this member with:

        CRTCLPGM PGM(ZLIB/COMPILE) SRCFILE(ZLIB/TOOLS) SRCMBR(COMPILE)


4)      Compile and generate the service program:

_       This can now be done by executing:

        CALL PGM(ZLIB/COMPILE)



II) From the original source distribution:

1)      On the AS400, create the source library:

        CRTLIB LIB(ZLIB) TYPE(PROD) TEXT('ZLIB compression API library')

2)      Create the source files:

        CRTSRCPF FILE(ZLIB/SOURCES) RCDLEN(112) TEXT('ZLIB library modules')
        CRTSRCPF FILE(ZLIB/H)       RCDLEN(112) TEXT('ZLIB library includes')
        CRTSRCPF FILE(ZLIB/TOOLS)   RCDLEN(112) TEXT('ZLIB library control utilities')

3)      From the machine hosting the distribution files, upload them (with
                FTP in text mode, for example) according to the following table:

    Original    AS400   AS400    AS400 AS400

                Please read comments in this member for more information


        Remember that most foreign textual data are ASCII coded: this
                implementation does not handle conversion from/to ASCII, so
                text data code conversions must be done explicitely


        Always open zipped files in binary mode

ZLib
Ada is a thick binding interface to the popular ZLib data
compression library, available at http://www
gzip

It provides Ada-style access to the ZLib C library



        Here are the main changes since ZLib
Ada 1

- Attension: ZLib


- Fix extraction to buffer with exact known decompressed size
 Error reported by
  Steve Sangwine
 Patch provided by Pascal Obry


- Add Status_Error exception definition
Streams
Stream_Element size is 8 bit
Ada under GNAT

You should have the ZLib library already build on your computer, before
building ZLib

Compatibility notes
===================

- Although the name ""zlib"" would have been more normal for the
  zlibpas unit, this name is already taken by Borland's ZLib unit

  This is somehow unfortunate, because that unit is not a genuine
  interface to the full-fledged zlib functionality, but a suite of
  class wrappers around zlib streams
  Other essential features,
  such as checksums, are missing

  It would have been more appropriate for that unit to have a name
  like ""ZStreams"", or something similar
 are
  translated directly into Pascal types of similar sizes (Integer,
  LongInt, etc
  In particular,
  there is no conversion of unsigned int into a Pascal unsigned
  integer
  Even if there is a 32-bit Cardinal type, there is no
  real need for unsigned int in zlib under a 32-bit environment

  Since the cdecl keyword is used, the old Turbo Pascal does
  not work with this interface

Additional notes
----------------
- This DLL, named zlibwapi
dll, is compatible to the old zlib
1
x sources, and distributed at
    http://www

- The new DLL was renamed because there exist several incompatible
  versions of zlib


- There is also an official DLL build of zlib, named zlib1
dll
 This one
  is exporting the functions using the CDECL convention

Overview
========

This directory contains an update to the ZLib interface unit,
distributed by Borland as a Delphi supplemental component
2
h header, and for 64-bit
  readiness


- The allocation and deallocation functions and function types
  (TAlloc, TFree, zlibAllocMem and zlibFreeMem) are now cdecl,
  and _malloc and _free are added as C RTL stubs
  Handling compressed file formats like ZIP/GZIP or PNG
cannot be implemented without having this functionality


Here are a few suggestions:

- Checksum class wrappers around adler32() and crc32(), similar
  to the Java classes that implement the java


- The ability to read and write raw deflate streams, without the
  zlib stream header and trailer
  Raw deflate streams are used
  in the ZIP file format


- The ability to read and write gzip streams, used in the GZIP
  file format, and normally produced by the gzip program


- The ability to select a different compression strategy, useful
  to PNG and MNG image compression, and to multimedia compression
  in general
  Besides the compression level

    TCompressionLevel = (clNone, clFastest, clDefault, clMax);

  which, in fact, could have used the 'z' prefix and avoided
  TColor-like symbols

    TCompressionLevel = (zcNone, zcFastest, zcDefault, zcMax);

  there could be a compression strategy

    TCompressionStrategy = (zsDefault, zsFiltered, zsHuffmanOnly, zsRle);

- ZIP and GZIP stream handling via TStreams
Net streaming wrappers for the gz streams part of zlib, and wrappers
for the checksum parts of zlib

Summary of modifications
========================

- Improved makefile, adapted to zlib version 1


- The zlib_version constant is updated


- The new Z_RLE strategy has its corresponding symbolic constant



Suggestions for improvements
============================

Currently, the ZLib unit provides only a limited wrapper around
the zlib library, and much of the original zlib functionality is
missing

Applications that handle these formats are either using their own,
duplicated code, or not using the ZLib unit at all

Pester
=======
Pester provides a framework for **running unit tests to execute and validate PowerShell commands from within PowerShell**
 Pester consists of a simple set of functions that expose a testing domain-specific language (DSL) for isolating, running, evaluating and reporting the results of PowerShell commands


Pester tests can execute any command or script that is accessible to a Pester test file
 This can include functions, cmdlets, modules and scripts
 Pester can be run in *ad-hoc* style in a console or **it can be integrated into the build scripts of a continuous integration (CI) system**


**Pester also contains a powerful set of mocking functions** in which tests mimic any command functionality within the tested PowerShell code


A Pester Test
-------------
BuildChanges
ps1

```powershell

function Build ($version) {
  write-host ""A build was run for version: $version""
}

function BuildIfChanged {
  $thisVersion=Get-Version
  $nextVersion=Get-NextVersion
  if($thisVersion -ne $nextVersion) {Build $nextVersion}
  return $nextVersion
}
```

BuildChanges
Tests
', '
 ""$here\$sut""

Describe ""BuildIfChanged"" {
  Context ""When there are changes"" {
    Mock Get-Version {return 1
1}
    Mock Get-NextVersion {return 1
2}
    Mock Build {} -Verifiable -ParameterFilter {$version -eq 1
2
      }
    }
  Context ""When there are no changes"" {
    Mock Get-Version -MockWith {return 1
ps1` recursively from the current directory and print a report of all failing and passing test results to the console
  There are several options for this integration:

- The `-OutputFile` parameter allows you to export data about the test execution
  After Pester finishes running, check the FailedCount property on the object to determine whether any tests failed, and take action from there
 This error code will be the number of failed tests; 0 indicates success
bat` in the `bin` folder which shows how you might integrate with a CI solution that does not support running PowerShell directly
  By wrapping a call to `Invoke-Pester` in a batch file, and making sure that batch file returns a non-zero exit code if any tests fail, you can still use Pester even when limited to cmd
exe commands in your CI jobs
 This is the method that we test and support in our releases

          Assert-MockCalled Build -Times 0 -ParameterFilter {$version -eq 1
1}
      }
    }
}
```

Running Tests
-------------
    C:\PS> Invoke-Pester

This will run all tests inside of files named `*
Tests


    C:\PS> Invoke-Pester -TestName BuildIfChanged

You can also run specific tests by using the `-TestName` parameter of the `Invoke-Pester` command
 The above example runs all tests with a `Describe` block named `BuildIfChanged`
 If you want to run multiple tests, you can pass a string array into the `-TestName` parameter, similar to the following example:

    C:\PS> Invoke-Pester -TestName BuildIfChanged, BaconShouldBeCrispy

Continuous Integration with Pester
-----------------------------------

Pester integrates well with almost any build automation solution
  Currently, this parameter allows you to produce NUnit-style XML output, which any modern CI solution should be able to read

- The `-EnableExit` switch causes Pester to exit the current PowerShell session with an error code


As an example, there is also a file named `Pester


Whenever possible, it's better to run Invoke-Pester directly (either in an interactive PowerShell session, or using CI software that supports running PowerShell steps in jobs)

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
, 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it
 This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it
 (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead
) You can apply it to your programs, too


When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it


For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights


We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software


Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software
 If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations


Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents
 We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary
 To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License
 The ""Program"", below, refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program"" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language
) Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope
 The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License


c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
 If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License
 For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable
 However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code


4
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it
 These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License


6
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions
 You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License
 For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices
 Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License


9
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
 If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation


10
 For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this


NO WARRANTY

11
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
 SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION


12





















"," By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users


The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ""modification""


1


2
 (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement
 But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


3
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code
 (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License


5
 Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it


7
 If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded
 In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License
 If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation
 Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally","

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works


8
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES"
